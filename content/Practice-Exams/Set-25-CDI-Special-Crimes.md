title: 'Practice Exam: Crime Detection & Investigation - Special Crimes (Set 25)'
description: 'A 30-question practice exam covering investigation of specific crimes including homicide, robbery, kidnapping, and arson.'
---

### 1. In a suspected homicide case, what is the most crucial first step for the investigator upon arriving at the crime scene?

- [ ] Immediately pursue any potential suspects seen leaving the area.
- [x] Secure the crime scene to prevent contamination or destruction of evidence.
- [ ] Interview all witnesses present at the scene.
- [ ] Check the victim for signs of life and administer first aid.

> Explanation: The first and most critical responsibility of the first responder or investigator is to secure the crime scene. This preserves the integrity of physical evidence which is vital for the investigation and prosecution. While other steps are important, they follow after the scene is properly cordoned off and protected.

### 2. An investigator finds a body with a single, deep stab wound to the chest and significant blood loss. There are no signs of a struggle. The victim's valuables are untouched. This scenario most strongly suggests what type of death?

- [ ] Accidental death
- [ ] Suicide
- [x] Homicide
- [ ] Natural causes

> Explanation: A single, deep stab wound in a vital area like the chest is a classic indicator of a homicidal attack. While suicide is possible, it is less common with stabbing than with other methods. The absence of struggle might indicate a surprise attack, and the untouched valuables rule out robbery as a primary motive, pointing towards a targeted killing.

### 3. What is the primary purpose of an autopsy in a medico-legal death investigation?

- [ ] To identify the deceased.
- [x] To determine the cause, manner, and time of death.
- [ ] To document injuries for insurance purposes.
- [ ] To prepare the body for burial.

> Explanation: The primary goal of a forensic autopsy is to scientifically establish the cause of death (the specific injury or disease that led to death), the manner of death (homicide, suicide, accident, natural, or undetermined), and to estimate the time of death.

### 4. In investigating a series of "Akyat-Bahay" gang robberies, what is the most effective method for identifying the perpetrators?

- [ ] Conducting random checkpoints in the affected neighborhoods.
- [x] Analyzing the Modus Operandi (MO) and looking for patterns across the incidents.
- [ ] Interviewing all known burglars in the city.
- [ ] Deploying a large number of uniformed patrols.

> Explanation: Professional criminal groups like "Akyat-Bahay" gangs often use a consistent Modus Operandi (MO). Analyzing the points of entry, tools used, types of items stolen, and time of day can create a distinct pattern that helps link cases and identify the specific group responsible.

### 5. Under Philippine law (RPC Art. 267), for kidnapping to be considered 'Kidnapping for Ransom', what element must be present?

- [ ] The victim must be a minor or a female.
- [ ] The abduction must be carried out by a group of at least three persons.
- [x] The abduction is committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person.
- [ ] The victim must be detained for more than three days.

> Explanation: The defining element of Kidnapping for Ransom is the motive. The perpetrator's intent must be to demand money, property, or any other form of payment (ransom) in exchange for the victim's release. Other circumstances affect the penalty but the purpose of extortion is the core element.

### 6. According to RA 8353 (The Anti-Rape Law of 1997), rape is classified as what type of crime?

- [ ] A crime against chastity.
- [x] A crime against persons.
- [ ] A crime against public morals.
- [ ] A private crime that requires the victim's complaint to prosecute.

> Explanation: RA 8353 reclassified rape from a crime against chastity to a crime against persons. This significant change recognizes rape as a form of violence and an assault on an individual's personal integrity and security, not just their "purity." It also made rape a public crime, meaning it can be prosecuted by the state even without the victim's complaint in many cases.

### 7. An arson investigator finds multiple, separate points of origin for a fire in a single building. What does this finding strongly indicate?

- [ ] The fire was caused by faulty electrical wiring.
- [ ] The fire was a result of an accidental grease fire in the kitchen.
- [x] The fire was intentionally set (incendiary).
- [ ] The fire spread rapidly due to the presence of flammable materials.

> Explanation: Multiple, unrelated points of origin are a classic and compelling indicator of arson. It is highly improbable for a single accidental fire to start in several different places simultaneously. This suggests that an accelerant was used to set fires in various locations to ensure maximum damage.

### 8. During a buy-bust operation under RA 9165, what is the most critical step immediately after the arrest of the suspect and seizure of the suspected drugs?

- [ ] The suspect must be immediately brought to the police station for booking.
- [ ] The media must be called to witness the successful operation.
- [x] The seized items must be immediately marked, physically inventoried, and photographed in the presence of the suspect and required witnesses.
- [ ] The suspected drugs must be sent to the crime lab for chemical analysis.

> Explanation: Section 21 of RA 9165 mandates a strict chain of custody procedure. Immediately after seizure, the apprehending team must conduct a physical inventory and photograph the items in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media or the DOJ, and any elected public official. Failure to follow this procedure can compromise the integrity of the evidence and lead to the dismissal of the case.

### 9. Which of the following scenarios best fits the definition of human trafficking under RA 9208?

- [ ] A person who helps a friend cross a border without proper documents for a fee.
- [x] A recruiter who promises a high-paying job in the city but forces the person into prostitution upon arrival.
- [ ] A parent who sends their child to live with a relative in another province for better education.
- [ ] An agency that legally facilitates overseas employment for Filipino workers.

> Explanation: RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act) defines trafficking through the elements of Acts, Means, and Purpose. The "Means" (fraud, deception, or abuse of vulnerability) and "Purpose" (exploitation, such as forced labor or sexual exploitation) are key. Promising a legitimate job and then forcing the person into prostitution is a classic example of trafficking through fraudulent recruitment for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

### 10. A computer user receives an email that appears to be from their bank, asking them to click a link and enter their account details to "verify their account." This is a classic example of what type of cybercrime?

- [ ] Hacking
- [ ] Malware attack
- [x] Phishing
- [ ] Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack

> Explanation: Phishing is a form of social engineering where attackers use fraudulent communications (like emails, text messages) disguised as coming from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and bank account details.

### 11. In a homicide investigation, the presence of "hesitation marks" or superficial, tentative cuts alongside a deep, fatal wound on a victim's wrist most likely suggests what manner of death?

- [ ] Homicide
- [x] Suicide
- [ ] Accidental
- [ ] Natural

> Explanation: Hesitation marks are common in suicides involving cutting instruments. They represent the person's initial, tentative attempts before summoning the resolve to make the final, fatal injury. Their presence is a strong, though not conclusive, indicator of suicide.

### 12. During the investigation of a robbery scene, an investigator finds a crowbar left near a forced-open door. What is the best way to collect this item for evidence?

- [ ] Pick it up with a gloved hand and place it in a paper bag.
- [x] Pick it up by a textured surface (to preserve fingerprints on smooth areas) with a gloved hand and secure it in a rigid box to prevent movement.
- [ ] Wipe it clean of any dirt before packaging it.
- [ ] Ask the owner of the house to handle it first to confirm it's not theirs.

> Explanation: The crowbar is a crucial piece of evidence that may contain fingerprints, DNA, and tool mark evidence. It must be handled minimally, by a surface least likely to hold prints (like the rough, textured grip), and secured in a rigid container to prevent the smudging of prints or transfer of trace evidence during transport.

### 13. Which of the following is NOT a primary objective of the initial phase of a kidnapping investigation?

- [ ] Ensure the safe recovery of the victim.
- [ ] Identify and apprehend the perpetrators.
- [x] Immediately publicize the kidnapping to the media to get public help.
- [ ] Establish a line of communication with the kidnappers.

> Explanation: Publicizing a kidnapping, especially in the early stages, is extremely dangerous. It can drive the kidnappers to panic, harm the victim, or cut off negotiations. The primary focus is always on the victim's safety, which often requires discreet and controlled communication and investigation.

### 14. An investigator is examining a fire scene and notices a "V" pattern on a wall, with the burn charring being deepest at the bottom point of the "V". What does this pattern typically indicate?

- [ ] The presence of a chemical accelerant.
- [x] The point of origin of the fire.
- [ ] That the fire was extinguished quickly.
- [ ] The direction the wind was blowing.

> Explanation: Fire burns upwards and outwards, creating a "V" or cone pattern on vertical surfaces. The lowest and deepest point of the charring within this "V" pattern is a reliable indicator of where the fire originated.

### 15. Under RA 9165, the possession of how many grams of shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) is considered a non-bailable offense?

- [ ] 1 gram or more
- [ ] 5 grams or more
- [x] 10 grams or more
- [ ] 50 grams or more

> Explanation: Section 11 of RA 9165 specifies the quantities for possession. While possession of any amount is illegal, possession of 10 grams or more of shabu, opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, or marijuana resin is a more serious offense that is generally non-bailable. (Note: The law has been amended by RA 10640 which adjusts the quantities but the principle of quantity-based penalties remains). As per the original law, 10g is the threshold.

### 16. What is the legal term for the physical evidence that proves a crime has been committed, such as a dead body in a murder case?

- [ ] Res gestae
- [x] Corpus delicti
- [ ] Modus operandi
- [ ] Stare decisis

> Explanation: Corpus delicti, Latin for "body of the crime," refers to the principle that it must be proven that a crime has occurred before a person can be convicted of that crime. In a murder case, the dead body is the literal corpus delicti, but the term more broadly includes all evidence that substantiates the commission of the crime.

### 17. A woman is found deceased in her locked apartment with no signs of forced entry. An empty bottle of sleeping pills is on her nightstand, along with a note. This situation is most indicative of:

- [ ] Homicide, staged to look like a suicide.
- [x] Suicide.
- [ ] Accidental overdose.
- [ ] Natural causes.

> Explanation: The combination of a secure, locked room (no forced entry), the means of death (sleeping pills), and a suicide note are all strong indicators of suicide. While a staged scene is a possibility an investigator must consider, these facts, on their face, point directly to suicide.

### 18. The "Golden Hour" in homicide investigation refers to:

- [ ] The first hour after the body is discovered.
- [x] The period immediately following the commission of the crime, where the chance of apprehending the suspect and collecting evidence is highest.
- [ ] The time it takes for the medico-legal officer to arrive.
- [ ] The last hour of the victim's life.

> Explanation: The "Golden Hour" is a term for the critical, short period of time right after a crime has been committed. During this window, evidence is fresh, witness memories are clearest, and the suspect is most likely to be near the scene or making mistakes. Swift and effective action during this period significantly increases the chances of solving the case.

### 19. An investigator is looking into a case where a suspect allegedly transferred money from a victim's bank account to their own using a computer. What is the most important type of evidence to secure?

- [ ] The suspect's browser history.
- [ ] The victim's email account.
- [x] Digital logs from the bank's server and the suspect's computer.
- [ ] The suspect's social media posts.

> Explanation: The most direct and conclusive evidence of an illicit electronic fund transfer would be the digital logs. Bank servers log all transaction details, including IP addresses, timestamps, and account numbers. Forensic analysis of the suspect's computer can link them to that transaction, creating a digital trail of the crime.

### 20. When investigating sexual assault, the victim's clothing should be collected and packaged how?

- [ ] All items should be placed together in a single plastic bag.
- [ ] The victim should be asked to wash the clothes before surrendering them.
- [x] Each item should be collected, air-dried if wet, and packaged separately in a paper bag.
- [ ] Only the undergarments are considered important evidence.

> Explanation: Each piece of clothing is a potential source of trace evidence like DNA, hair, or fibers. To prevent cross-contamination, each item must be packaged separately. Plastic bags trap moisture which can degrade biological evidence, so paper bags are always used. Air-drying wet items is crucial to prevent mold and bacterial growth.

### 21. What is the primary investigative goal in a robbery case, besides recovering the stolen property?

- [ ] To determine the exact value of the stolen items.
- [ ] To file the appropriate insurance claims for the victim.
- [x] To identify and link the suspect to the crime scene or the stolen goods.
- [ ] To establish the time the robbery occurred.

> Explanation: While other goals are part of the process, the ultimate investigative aim is to solve the crime. This requires linking a specific suspect to the act of robbery, either through forensic evidence from the scene (fingerprints, DNA), witness identification, or by tracing the stolen property back to the suspect.

### 22. In the Philippines, which agency is the lead in conducting investigations for large-scale and complex arson cases?

- [ ] The Philippine National Police (PNP).
- [x] The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP).
- [ ] The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).
- [ ] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

> Explanation: Under the Fire Code of the Philippines (RA 9514), the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) has the primary mandate and jurisdiction over the prevention and suppression of all destructive fires, including the investigation of their causes and the filing of arson cases.

### 23. A key piece of evidence in a homicide case is a fired cartridge case found at the scene. What specific type of forensic analysis can link this cartridge case to a particular firearm?

- [ ] Ballistics analysis
- [x] Tool mark analysis
- [ ] Chemical analysis
- [ ] DNA analysis

> Explanation: When a gun is fired, its internal mechanisms (firing pin, breech face, extractor, ejector) leave unique, microscopic scratches and impressions on the cartridge case. This is a form of tool mark analysis. Forensic experts can compare these unique marks on a crime scene cartridge to test-fired cartridges from a suspect's gun to make a conclusive match. Ballistics refers to the flight path of the projectile, not the markings.

### 24. What law specifically criminalizes violence against women and their children, providing for protective measures and specific procedures for investigation?

- [ ] RA 8353 (Anti-Rape Law)
- [ ] RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act)
- [x] RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act)
- [ ] RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act)

> Explanation: RA 9262 is the landmark legislation that defines and penalizes physical, sexual, psychological, and economic violence against women and their children. It provides the legal framework and mechanisms, such as Barangay Protection Orders (BPOs) and Temporary/Permanent Protection Orders (TPOs/PPOs), for handling these specific cases.

### 25. Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a typical serial killer?

- [ ] A cooling-off period between murders.
- [ ] The murders are often connected to a psychological motive, not material gain.
- [x] The victims are usually killed in a moment of rage or passion with no planning.
- [ ] The killer often follows a specific ritual or signature in their crimes.

> Explanation: Serial murder is characterized by planning, a psychological compulsion, and a "cooling-off" period between killings. Murders committed in a sudden fit of rage or passion are more characteristic of other types of homicide, not the patterned, psychologically-driven crimes of a serial killer.

### 26. In a kidnapping case, what is the role of a "non-negotiable" demand from the perpetrators?

- [ ] It's a sign that the kidnappers are amateurs.
- [ ] It means the victim is likely already dead.
- [x] It's often a tactic to test the resolve and financial capacity of the victim's family.
- [ ] It indicates the kidnappers are not interested in money.

> Explanation: Experienced kidnappers often start with extreme, non-negotiable demands to create a high-pressure situation. This is a psychological tactic to gauge the family's reaction, establish control, and set a high anchor point for the subsequent, more realistic negotiations.

### 27. The concept of "Fruit of the Poisonous Tree" in evidence admissibility means:

- [ ] All evidence, no matter how obtained, is admissible in court.
- [x] Evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search or seizure is inadmissible.
- [ ] Evidence that is rotten or decayed is not useful.
- [ ] The testimony of a known criminal is always suspect.

> Explanation: This legal doctrine, an extension of the exclusionary rule, states that any evidence that is discovered as a result of an earlier illegal act (the "poisonous tree," such as an illegal search or a coerced confession) is itself tainted and cannot be used in court (it is the "fruit").

### 28. What is the primary difference between robbery and theft (in the context of Philippine law)?

- [ ] The value of the property taken.
- [x] The use of violence, intimidation, or force upon persons or things.
- [ ] The time of day the crime was committed.
- [ ] The number of perpetrators involved.

> Explanation: The core element that distinguishes robbery from theft under the Revised Penal Code is the means of taking. Robbery involves violence against or intimidation of any person, or force upon things. Theft is the taking of personal property without the owner's consent, but without the use of violence, intimidation, or force.

### 29. A post-mortem examination reveals "petechial hemorrhages" in the victim's eyes and on the internal eyelids. This finding is a classic sign of what cause of death?

- [ ] Stabbing
- [x] Asphyxia (strangulation or suffocation)
- [ ] Poisoning
- [ ] Drowning

> Explanation: Petechial hemorrhages are tiny, pinpoint ruptures of capillaries caused by a rapid increase in venous pressure. They are a hallmark sign of asphyxia, commonly seen in cases of manual strangulation, hanging, or suffocation, as the pressure buildup in the head causes these small vessels to burst.

### 30. During a crime scene search for a homicide, an investigator finds a bloody fingerprint on a glass table. What search pattern would be most effective for a small, defined area like this?

- [ ] Line or strip search
- [ ] Grid search
- [x] Spiral or circular search
- [ ] Zone or quadrant search

> Explanation: For a small, specific object or area like a tabletop with a key piece of evidence already located, a spiral search is highly effective. The investigator can start at the outer edge and spiral inward toward the fingerprint, or start at the fingerprint and spiral outward, ensuring complete and detailed coverage of the immediate area without missing other potential trace evidence.
