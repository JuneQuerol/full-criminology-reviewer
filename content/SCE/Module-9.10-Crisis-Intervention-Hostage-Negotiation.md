## I. Crisis Intervention

Police officers encounter people in crisis every day. This can include victims of crime, people with mental illness, individuals contemplating suicide, or people involved in volatile domestic disputes.

### A. The Goals of Crisis Intervention
The primary goals are to:
1.  **Ensure Safety:** The immediate priority is the safety of the person in crisis, the public, and the responding officers.
2.  **De-escalate the Situation:** To use communication skills to reduce the intensity of the situation and calm the person down.
3.  **Provide Immediate Support:** To offer psychological first aid and connect the person with the appropriate resources (e.g., medical help, mental health services, a social worker).
4.  **Restore Functioning:** To help the person regain a sense of control and return to their normal level of functioning.

### B. Basic Crisis Intervention Techniques
- **Establish Rapport:** Introduce yourself and try to build a connection with the person.
- **Use Active Listening Skills:** Show that you are listening and trying to understand their perspective. Paraphrase what they say ("So, what you're saying is...").
- **Be Empathetic and Non-Judgmental:** Acknowledge their feelings ("I can see that you're very upset right now.").
- **Use a Calm and Reassuring Tone of Voice.**
- **Provide Clear, Simple Directions.**
- **Focus on the "Here and Now":** Help them focus on the immediate problem and how to solve it.

## III. The Behavioral Change Stairway Model

This is a model developed by the FBI's Hostage Negotiation Unit that outlines the five steps to getting a person in crisis to change their behavior and comply with your requests. You must complete each step before moving to the next.

### Step 1: Active Listening
- **Goal:** To understand the hostage-taker's perspective and to show them that you are listening.
- **Techniques:**
    - **Paraphrasing:** Repeating the subject's message in your own words.
    - **Emotion Labeling:** Acknowledging their feelings ("You sound very angry about this.").
    - **Minimal Encouragers:** Using simple phrases like "uh-huh," "okay," and "I see" to encourage them to keep talking.
- This is the foundation of the entire process.

### Step 2: Empathy
- **Goal:** To go beyond understanding their perspective and to actually show that you appreciate how they are feeling.
- **Technique:** "It sounds like you feel betrayed." "I can see why you feel that this is unfair."
- **Important:** Empathy is **not** sympathy or agreement. You are not saying, "I agree with you." You are saying, "I understand the feeling behind what you are saying."

### Step 3: Rapport
- **Goal:** Empathy is what you feel. Rapport is when *they feel it back*. At this stage, the hostage-taker begins to trust the negotiator and see them as an ally.
- **Indication:** The subject starts to listen to the negotiator and accept their suggestions.

### Step 4: Influence
- **Goal:** Once trust has been established, the negotiator can begin to influence the hostage-taker's behavior.
- **Technique:** The negotiator starts to offer solutions and work collaboratively with the subject on a way out of the crisis. "Let's figure out how we can get you out of this safely."

### Step 5: Behavioral Change
- **Goal:** The hostage-taker acts on the negotiator's suggestions and surrenders peacefully.
- This is the ultimate goal, but it can only be achieved after the first four steps have been successfully completed. Rushing to this step without building a foundation of listening and rapport will almost always fail.

**Board Exam Tip:** Memorize the five steps of the Behavioral Change Stairway in order: Active Listening, Empathy, Rapport, Influence, Behavioral Change.

*Ang **Behavioral Change Stairway Model** ay GUARANTEED na lalabas sa board exam! Ito ay 5-step process ng FBI para sa hostage negotiation. TANDAAN MO 'TO:*

**Step 1: ACTIVE LISTENING**
*Hindi ka pwedeng magsalita agad! MAKINIG ka muna. Paraphrase mo yung sinasabi niya ("So ang ibig mong sabihin ay..."), label ang emotions niya ("You sound very angry"), at gumamit ng minimal encouragers ("Uh-huh, okay, sige"). Ang goal: para maramdaman niya na NARIRINIG mo siya.*

**Step 2: EMPATHY**
*I-appreciate mo kung paano siya nakakaramdam. "I understand why you feel betrayed." Hindi ibig sabihin SUMASANG-AYON ka - ibig sabihin NAIINTINDIHAN mo lang ang feelings niya. May difference yan!*

**Step 3: RAPPORT**
*Ito yung point na nagsisimula nang magtiwala sa'yo ang hostage-taker. Nakikita ka na niyang ALLY, hindi ENEMY. Nagsisimulang makinig sa'yo.*

**Step 4: INFLUENCE**
*Ngayon pwede ka na mag-offer ng solutions. "Let's figure out how we can get you out of this safely." Collaborative approach na.*

**Step 5: BEHAVIORAL CHANGE**
*ANG GOAL! Sumuko na peacefully ang hostage-taker. Pero matandaan: hindi mo ma-achieve ang Step 5 kung hindi mo na-complete ang Steps 1-4! Kaya nga "stairway" - kailangan hakbang-hakbang, hindi pwedeng jump directly sa Step 5!*

*MEMORIZATION TIP: **A-E-R-I-B** (parang "AEROBIC") - **A**ctive Listening, **E**mpathy, **R**apport, **I**nfluence, **B**ehavioral Change.*

*COMMON MISTAKE: Yung mga baguhan na negotiator, gusto nila agad Step 5 (sumuko ka na!). Pero ang hostage-taker ay hindi pa ready kasi wala pang trust. Kaya FAIL. Kailangan mong BUILD TRUST FIRST through Steps 1-4!*

## Conclusion

Crisis intervention and hostage negotiation are among the most psychologically demanding tasks in law enforcement. They require a complete shift from a traditional, authoritative police mindset to one of empathy, patience, and active listening. The primary goal is always the preservation of human life. By using proven communication techniques, as outlined in the Behavioral Change Stairway model, negotiators can de-escalate volatile situations, build trust with people in crisis, and guide them toward a peaceful resolution. It is a field where the power of words is often far more effective than the power of force.

## Introduction

Police officers are often the first to respond to people in a state of acute crisis. A **crisis** is a situation where a person's normal coping mechanisms have failed, leaving them in a state of psychological disequilibrium. **Crisis Intervention** is the set of immediate, short-term psychological first aid techniques used to help a person in crisis deal with the situation and regain control. One of the most intense and high-stakes forms of crisis intervention is **Hostage Negotiation**. This module will cover the basic principles of crisis intervention and the specific strategies and goals of hostage negotiation.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define "crisis" and "crisis intervention."
- Identify the goals of crisis intervention.
- Describe the "Behavioral Change Stairway" model of negotiation.
- Understand the critical role of communication in negotiation.
- Explain the primary objectives and priorities in a hostage situation.


## II. Hostage Negotiation: A Specialized Crisis

A **hostage situation** is a type of crisis where one or more persons (the **hostages**) are held against their will by another person (the **hostage-taker**) who is making demands. Hostage negotiation is a specialized form of crisis intervention that requires advanced training.

### A. Priorities in a Hostage Situation
The priorities in any hostage situation are always in this order:
1.  **Preservation of Life:** This includes the lives of the hostages, the public, the police, and **the hostage-taker**. The number one goal is that everyone gets out alive.
2.  **Apprehension of the Hostage-Taker.**
3.  **Recovery of Property.**

**The "No-Concession" Policy:** Most police agencies have a policy of not making major concessions to a hostage-taker's demands, such as providing weapons, another hostage, or a major means of escape. Doing so would only encourage more hostage-takings in the future. However, negotiators can and do make concessions on smaller items (food, water, electricity) to build rapport.

*Ang **PRIORITIES sa Hostage Situation** (MEMORIZE THE ORDER!):*
1. ***PRESERVATION OF LIFE*** - **BUHAY ANG NUMBER 1!** Lahat dapat mabuhay - hostages, publiko, pulis, at kahit ang HOSTAGE-TAKER mismo! Goal: walang mamamatay.
2. ***APPREHENSION*** - Mahuli ang hostage-taker.
3. ***PROPERTY*** - Last priority lang ito. Ang buhay ay mas importante kaysa pera o gamit.

*Tandaan: ang order ay **L-A-P** (Life, Apprehension, Property) - parang "LAP" na uupuan mo!*

*Ang **"No-Concession Policy"** - hindi ka pwedeng bigyan ng major demands like weapons, transportation para makatakas, o dagdag na hostage. Pero pwede kang magbigay ng small things like FOOD, WATER, ELECTRICITY para makabuild ng rapport. Yung small concessions ay part ng negotiation strategy.*

### B. The Role of the Negotiator
- The **Primary Negotiator** is the only person who communicates directly with the hostage-taker.
- **Their Goal is NOT to "solve" the problem.** Their goal is to **buy time** and use communication to de-escalate the situation, build a relationship with the hostage-taker, and encourage a peaceful surrender.
- **Time is on the side of the police.** The longer the situation goes on, the more likely it is to be resolved peacefully. Time allows the hostage-taker to calm down, for rapport to be built, and for the tactical team (SWAT) to gather intelligence and prepare.


## IV. The Concept of Stockholm Syndrome

- **Definition:** Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where hostages develop a bond and feelings of sympathy or affection for their captors.
- **Mechanism:** It is a coping mechanism. The hostage may begin to identify with the hostage-taker as a way to survive the intense and terrifying situation.
- **Implications for Negotiation:**
    - It can be a positive thing, as the hostage-taker may also develop a bond with the hostage and be less likely to harm them.
    - It can be a negative thing, as the hostage may refuse to cooperate with the police during or after the incident.
- It is a rare but well-documented phenomenon.

*Ang **Stockholm Syndrome** ay WEIRD but true psychological phenomenon - yung HOSTAGE ay nagiging SYMPATHETIC sa HOSTAGE-TAKER! Parang nag-develop ng feelings or affection para sa kidnapper niya. Ano ang cause? **COPING MECHANISM** yan - survival instinct. Para ma-survive, yung hostage ay nag-identify sa captor niya, nag-empathize sa kanya.*

*Example: May bank robbery, may hostages. After several hours, nagsisimulang mag-kwentuhan ang hostages at ang robbers. Eventually, ang hostages ay nag-defend pa ng robbers sa pulis - "Huwag niyong saktan sila! Mabait naman sila sa amin!"*

*GOOD or BAD?*
- ***GOOD:*** Kung may Stockholm Syndrome, less likely na sasaktan ng hostage-taker ang hostage kasi may emotional bond na.
- ***BAD:*** Yung hostage ay pwedeng TUMANGGI na makipagtulungan sa pulis, even after ma-rescue na siya.

*Bakit "Stockholm" Syndrome? Kasi naganap 'to sa Stockholm, Sweden noong 1973 - may bank robbery at ang hostages ay nag-defend pa ng robbers after!*

**Board Exam Tip:** *Stockholm Syndrome = Hostage develops sympathy for captor. Coping/survival mechanism. Can be good (less harm) or bad (non-cooperation with police).*
