title: 'Practice Exam: Sociology of Crimes & Ethics - Classical & Positivist Theories (Set 27)'
description: 'A 30-question practice exam covering criminological theories from the Classical and Positivist schools of thought.'
---

### 1. Which of the following is the core principle of the Classical School of Criminology?

- [ ] Criminal behavior is a result of biological and hereditary factors.
- [x] Individuals are rational beings who choose to commit crimes based on a pleasure/pain calculation.
- [ ] Crime is a social phenomenon learned through association with others.
- [ ] The legal system should be based on the rehabilitation of the offender.

> Explanation: The Classical School, led by thinkers like Cesare Beccaria, is founded on the concept of rational choice and free will. It posits that people weigh the potential pleasure (benefit) of a crime against the potential pain (punishment) and make a rational decision.

### 2. Cesare Beccaria, in his essay "On Crimes and Punishments," argued for which principle of justice?

- [ ] The punishment should be severe enough to create terror in other potential offenders.
- [ ] The purpose of punishment is retribution for the harm done to society.
- [x] The punishment should be swift, certain, and proportionate to the crime committed.
- [ ] Judges should have wide discretion in determining the appropriate punishment.

> Explanation: Beccaria's framework for an effective justice system emphasized three key elements: celerity (swiftness), certainty (high probability of being caught and punished), and proportionality (the punishment should fit the crime, not be excessive). This forms the basis of modern deterrence theory.

### 3. What is the "hedonistic calculus" as proposed by Jeremy Bentham?

- [ ] A method for determining a criminal's biological predisposition to crime.
- [ ] A system for classifying different types of criminal offenders.
- [x] A belief that individuals calculate the degree of pleasure or pain that a specific action will cause.
- [ ] A legal doctrine that prioritizes the rights of the accused above all else.

> Explanation: Jeremy Bentham, a key figure in the Classical School, developed the concept of the "hedonistic calculus." It suggests that human beings are fundamentally driven by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, and this calculation guides their decisions, including the choice to commit a crime.

### 4. The Positivist School of Criminology shifted the focus of study from the crime itself to the:

- [ ] Social structure and economic conditions.
- [ ] Effectiveness of the criminal justice system.
- [x] Criminal offender and the causes of their behavior.
- [ ] Nature of law and its application.

> Explanation: The Positivist School marked a paradigm shift by applying the scientific method to the study of crime. Instead of focusing on the legal aspects of the act (the crime), positivists like Lombroso, Ferri, and Garofalo focused on the offender, seeking to identify the biological, psychological, or social factors that determined their criminal behavior.

### 5. Cesare Lombroso's theory of the "born criminal" is primarily based on which concept?

- [ ] Social learning
- [x] Atavism
- [ ] Psychoanalytic conflict
- [ ] Economic determinism

> Explanation: Lombroso's theory of the "born criminal" proposed that some individuals are evolutionary throwbacks to a more primitive stage of human development. He used the term "atavism" to describe this condition, identifying physical stigmata (e.g., large jaws, high cheekbones) as indicators of this supposed biological inferiority.

### 6. According to Lombroso, what are "stigmata"?

- [ ] Scars or marks obtained during the commission of a crime.
- [ ] Tattoos associated with prison gangs.
- [x] Physical anomalies that he believed were indicators of a primitive or atavistic nature.
- [ ] Social labels that marginalize individuals and push them toward crime.

> Explanation: Lombroso's concept of stigmata included features like a sloping forehead, ears of unusual size, asymmetry of the face, and an excessive length of arms. He wrongly believed these physical traits were signs of a "born criminal."

### 7. Which theorist is credited with developing the theory of "somatotyping," which links body type to temperament and criminality?

- [ ] Enrico Ferri
- [ ] Raffaele Garofalo
- [x] William Sheldon
- [ ] Charles Goring

> Explanation: William Sheldon developed the theory of somatotyping in the 1940s. He classified body types into three categories: ectomorphs (thin, fragile), endomorphs (soft, round), and mesomorphs (muscular, athletic), and argued that mesomorphs were most prone to aggression and delinquency.

### 8. An individual who is muscular, assertive, and action-oriented would be classified as what somatotype according to Sheldon?

- [ ] Ectomorph
- [ ] Endomorph
- [x] Mesomorph
- [ ] Atavistic

> Explanation: Sheldon's typology links the mesomorphic body type (hard, muscular, athletic build) with a temperament he called "somatotonia" (assertive, aggressive, action-oriented), which he believed correlated with a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.

### 9. The Neo-classical School of Criminology modified the pure rational choice model of the Classical School by acknowledging that certain factors can inhibit the exercise of free will. Which of the following is an example of such a factor?

- [ ] Low social status
- [x] Insanity or mental illness
- [ ] Lack of educational opportunity
- [ ] Peer pressure

> Explanation: The Neo-classical school emerged as a response to the rigidity of the Classical school. It conceded that factors like age (infancy), mental state (insanity), and other extenuating circumstances could impair an individual's ability to make a fully rational choice, thus justifying a need for judicial discretion and consideration of mitigating circumstances.

### 10. Which of the following best defines "natural crimes" as conceptualized by Raffaele Garofalo?

- [ ] Acts that are only criminal because they are prohibited by law.
- [x] Acts that violate the fundamental moral sentiments of pity and probity.
- [ ] Crimes committed by individuals in a state of nature, without a government.
- [ ] Offenses against the environment and natural resources.

> Explanation: Garofalo, a student of Lombroso, sought a sociological definition of crime. He proposed that "natural crimes" are those that offend the basic moral sentiments common to all people, specifically pity (revulsion against the voluntary infliction of suffering) and probity (respect for the property rights of others).

### 11. Enrico Ferri, a prominent positivist, expanded Lombroso's work by emphasizing the importance of which factors in causing crime?

- [ ] Classical and Neo-classical principles.
- [ ] The swiftness and certainty of punishment.
- [x] Social, economic, and political factors.
- [ ] The structure of the criminal justice system.

> Explanation: While Ferri accepted Lombroso's biological positivism, he argued that it was insufficient. He developed a multi-causal approach, stressing that crime was the product of an interplay between anthropological (biological/hereditary), physical (geographic/climate), and social (economic/political) factors.

### 12. Deterrence theory, which is a modern extension of Classical principles, distinguishes between two types of deterrence. What are they?

- [ ] Active and passive deterrence
- [ ] Primary and secondary deterrence
- [x] General and specific deterrence
- [ ] Individual and societal deterrence

> Explanation: General deterrence aims to prevent crime in the general population by making an example of offenders. Specific deterrence aims to prevent a particular offender from re-offending by instilling in them a fear of future punishment.

### 13. The idea that punishment should be just severe enough to outweigh the pleasure or benefit derived from the crime is most closely associated with:

- [ ] Cesare Lombroso's criminal anthropology.
- [x] Jeremy Bentham's principle of utility.
- [ ] Enrico Ferri's law of criminal saturation.
- [ ] Raffaele Garofalo's concept of moral anomaly.

> Explanation: Bentham's principle of utility, a cornerstone of his philosophy, holds that the morally right action is the one that maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain for the greatest number. In the context of punishment, this means the pain of the punishment must slightly exceed the pleasure of the crime to effectively deter it.

### 14. A key difference between the Classical and Positivist schools is their view on punishment. The Classical school advocates for punishment based on ________, while the Positivist school advocates for treatment based on ________.

- [ ] The offender's background; the nature of the crime
- [x] The crime committed; the individual offender's characteristics
- [ ] Social necessity; divine right
- [ ] Retribution; rehabilitation only

> Explanation: The Classical school operates on a "let the punishment fit the crime" philosophy, where the act itself determines the penalty. The Positivist school, in contrast, operates on a "let the treatment fit the individual" philosophy, where the goal is to address the biological, psychological, or social factors causing the person's criminality.

### 15. The scientific study of the physical attributes of offenders and their supposed relationship to criminal behavior is known as:

- [ ] Phrenology
- [x] Criminal Anthropology
- [ ] Somatotyping
- [ ] Physiognomy

> Explanation: Criminal Anthropology was the field pioneered by Cesare Lombroso. It involved the systematic measurement and observation of the physical characteristics of criminals to identify supposed biological markers of criminality. Phrenology (skull shape) and Physiognomy (facial features) were related but more specific pseudo-sciences.

### 16. Rational Choice Theory, a modern descendant of the Classical School, views crime as:

- [ ] An irrational outburst of deep-seated psychological issues.
- [ ] A product of a deterministic biological makeup.
- [x] A decision-making process in which the offender evaluates the potential costs and benefits.
- [ ] A result of societal breakdown and anomie.

> Explanation: Rational Choice Theory revives the core Classical ideas of free will and hedonism. It posits that offenders are not compelled but choose to commit crimes after a rational (though perhaps not sophisticated) calculation of risks (e.g., getting caught) versus rewards (e.g., financial gain, excitement).

### 17. Which school of thought first introduced the concept of mitigating circumstances, such as age or mental capacity, into the administration of criminal justice?

- [ ] The Positive School
- [ ] The Chicago School
- [x] The Neo-classical School
- [ ] The Classical School

> Explanation: The Neo-classical School was a compromise between the strict, unyielding doctrines of the Classical School and the deterministic views of the Positivist School. It modified classicism by allowing for exceptions to the "free will" doctrine, thereby admitting that factors like insanity, age, or duress could reduce or negate criminal responsibility.

### 18. According to Positivist thinkers like Ferri, if crime is caused by factors beyond an individual's control, what is the logical implication for the concept of "mens rea" or criminal intent?

- [ ] It becomes the most important element of a crime.
- [ ] It is the sole factor determining the length of a sentence.
- [x] It becomes irrelevant, as the person did not freely "choose" to be a criminal.
- [ ] It can only be determined through psychoanalysis.

> Explanation: For strict positivists, the concept of "free will" is an illusion. If behavior is determined by biological, psychological, or social forces, then an individual cannot be said to have freely formed "criminal intent" (mens rea). The focus shifts from moral guilt to the individual's dangerousness and the need for treatment or incapacitation.

### 19. A judge sentences a thief to a long prison term not only to punish the individual but also to send a message to the community that theft will not be tolerated. This is a clear example of:

- [ ] Specific deterrence
- [x] General deterrence
- [ ] Incapacitation
- [ ] Rehabilitation

> Explanation: The judge's intention to influence the behavior of the wider community by making an example of the convicted thief is the definition of general deterrence. Specific deterrence would focus only on preventing that individual thief from reoffending.

### 20. The Positivist school is often criticized for its potential to lead to what kind of justice system policies?

- [ ] Overly lenient and permissive sentencing.
- [ ] A focus on victim's rights above all else.
- [x] Policies that could involve discrimination and loss of civil liberties based on supposed biological or psychological traits.
- [ ] A complete dismantling of prisons in favor of community corrections.

> Explanation: Because positivism can suggest that criminality is a pre-determined trait, it opens the door to dangerous policies. Critics argue that it could justify profiling, eugenics, or the indefinite confinement of individuals deemed "dangerous" based on tests or physical features, regardless of whether they have committed a crime.

### 21. Which statement best summarizes the main contribution of the Classical School to criminology?

- [ ] It provided the first scientific explanation for criminal behavior.
- [x] It established the first rational and systematic legal framework for crime and punishment.
- [ ] It identified the root causes of crime in social inequality.
- [ ] It developed effective rehabilitation programs for offenders.

> Explanation: The Classical School's lasting legacy is its influence on legal reform. It moved Western legal systems away from arbitrary, cruel, and secretive punishments towards a system based on clear laws, due process, and the principle that punishment should be proportionate and serve a deterrent purpose.

### 22. "The born criminal, the insane criminal, and the criminaloid." This classification of offenders was proposed by:

- [ ] Jeremy Bentham
- [ ] Enrico Ferri
- [x] Cesare Lombroso
- [ ] Raffaele Garofalo

> Explanation: Cesare Lombroso developed this typology. The "born criminal" was the atavistic, biologically determined offender. The "insane criminal" was driven by mental illness. The "criminaloid" was a large general class of offenders whose criminality was less biologically determined and more a product of opportunity or circumstance, but who still possessed some predisposing traits.

### 23. The principle of "proportionality" in the Classical School means:

- [ ] The punishment should be proportional to the offender's wealth.
- [ ] The punishment should be decided by a jury of the offender's peers.
- [x] The severity of the punishment should match the severity of the crime.
- [ ] The punishment should be proportional to the public's outrage.

> Explanation: Proportionality is a cornerstone of Beccaria's philosophy. It insists that the harm of the punishment should not exceed the harm of the crime, ensuring a just and balanced legal system and preventing the state from inflicting cruel and unusual punishment.

### 24. Psychological Positivism seeks the cause of crime within an individual's:

- [ ] Social environment
- [ ] Economic status
- [x] Personality, learning processes, and mental state
- [ ] Body type and genetics

> Explanation: While biological positivism looks at physical traits, psychological positivism focuses on internal, non-physical factors. This includes theories about personality disorders (e.g., psychopathy), cognitive deficits, learned behaviors through conditioning, and psychoanalytic conflicts as causes of criminality.

### 25. Charles Goring's study, "The English Convict," was a significant challenge to Lombroso's theories because it found:

- [ ] That criminals were, on average, more intelligent than non-criminals.
- [ ] That social factors like poverty were the only cause of crime.
- [x] No significant physical differences between criminals and non-criminals, except for height and weight.
- [ ] That Lombroso's "stigmata" were actually signs of genius.

> Explanation: Goring conducted a large-scale statistical comparison of English convicts and a control group of non-criminals (university students, soldiers). His findings directly contradicted Lombroso's theory of a distinct physical "criminal type," as he found no evidence of an "atavistic man." This was a major blow to purely biological positivism.

### 26. A theory arguing that crime rates are influenced by the availability of suitable targets, the absence of capable guardians, and the presence of motivated offenders is an evolution of which school's principles?

- [ ] Positivist School
- [x] Classical School
- [ ] Chicago School
- [ ] Conflict School

> Explanation: This describes Routine Activity Theory, a modern variant of Rational Choice Theory. It builds directly on Classical school ideas by focusing on the circumstances and opportunities for crime. A rational, motivated offender makes a choice when a target is vulnerable (no guardian).

### 27. The Positivist method of inquiry in criminology is known as:

- [ ] Jurisprudence
- [x] The scientific method (determinism)
- [ ] Introspection
- [ ] Textual criticism

> Explanation: Positivism is defined by its application of the scientific method to social phenomena. It seeks to find measurable, observable causes for behavior, operating on the principle of determinism—that events (including crime) are the result of preceding causes.

### 28. If a theorist believes that criminals are "morally less developed" than non-criminals and require treatment to develop a sense of right and wrong, their view aligns with:

- [ ] Classical Deterrence Theory
- [x] Psychological Positivism
- [ ] Biological Positivism
- [ ] Sociological Positivism

> Explanation: This perspective falls under psychological positivism, specifically within the branch of cognitive theories. It suggests that criminals have faulty reasoning, a lack of empathy, or are stuck at an earlier stage of moral development (e.g., Kohlberg's stages), and that cognitive-behavioral therapy or other interventions can "correct" this deficit.

### 29. The main objective of punishment, according to the Classical School, is:

- [ ] Retribution
- [ ] Rehabilitation
- [x] Deterrence
- [ ] Incapacitation

> Explanation: For classical thinkers like Beccaria and Bentham, the primary and almost sole purpose of punishment was to deter crime. It was not about exacting revenge (retribution) or fixing the offender (rehabilitation), but about making the cost of crime high enough to prevent both the offender and others from committing it in the future.

### 30. Which of the following is a key legacy of the Positivist School on the modern criminal justice system?

- [ ] The right to a speedy and public trial.
- [x] The introduction of the pre-sentence investigation report and indeterminate sentencing.
- [ ] The principle of "innocent until proven guilty."
- [ ] The abolition of cruel and unusual punishment.

> Explanation: The Positivist focus on the individual offender and their unique characteristics led to reforms aimed at individualizing punishment. The pre-sentence report, which details an offender's background, is used to help a judge decide on a suitable sentence. Indeterminate sentences (e.g., 5-10 years) allow for the offender to be released when they are deemed "rehabilitated" or no longer a threat, which is a core positivist idea.
