## I. Biological Theories of Crime

Biological theories are based on the idea that criminal behavior is caused by some physical or biological factor that is internal to the individual.

### A. Early Biological Theories (The Italian School)
- **Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909):** The "Father of Modern Criminology."
    - **Theory of Atavism:** Lombroso argued that criminals were "atavistic"—biological throwbacks to a more primitive stage of human evolution. He believed that these "born criminals" could be identified by certain physical **stigmata** (physical anomalies).
    - **Stigmata:** These included things like a large jaw, a sloping forehead, long arms, and an insensitivity to pain.
    - **Legacy:** While Lombroso's specific theory of atavism has been thoroughly **discredited**, his work was revolutionary because it was the first major attempt to apply the scientific method to the study of the criminal, marking the beginning of the Positivist School.

### B. Modern Biological Theories (Biosocial Criminology)
Modern biological theories are much more sophisticated. They do not argue that biology is a "destiny," but rather that certain biological factors can **predispose** an individual to criminal behavior, especially when combined with certain social or environmental factors.

1.  **Genetics:**
    - **Twin Studies:** Studies have shown that **identical twins** (who share 100% of their genes) have a much higher concordance rate for criminal behavior than **fraternal twins** (who share only 50% of their genes). This suggests a genetic component.
    - **Adoption Studies:** Studies have found that adopted children whose **biological parents** were criminals are more likely to become criminals themselves, even if their adoptive parents are law-abiding. This further supports a genetic link.

2.  **Neurocriminology (The Brain):**
    - This field studies the relationship between brain structure and function and criminal behavior.
    - **Prefrontal Cortex:** Research has shown that many violent offenders have damage or reduced activity in the **prefrontal cortex**, the part of the brain responsible for executive functions like self-control, planning, and regulating emotions.
    - **Neurotransmitters:** Imbalances in brain chemicals like **serotonin** (which affects mood and impulse control) and **dopamine** (related to reward-seeking behavior) have been linked to aggression and violence.

3.  **Hormones:**
    - High levels of the male hormone **testosterone** have been linked to increased aggression and dominance-seeking behavior.

## Conclusion

Biological and psychological theories provide a crucial micro-level perspective on crime, focusing on the characteristics of the individual offender. While early theories like Lombroso's have been discredited, modern biosocial criminology uses advanced technology to show that genetics, brain structure, and brain chemistry can indeed create predispositions for criminal behavior. Similarly, psychological theories show how personality, developmental experiences, and learned behaviors can shape a person's path toward or away from crime. These theories remind us that while social conditions are important, the ultimate decision to commit a crime is made by an individual, and the factors that influence that decision are often deeply rooted in their biology and psychology.

## Introduction

While the Classical School focused on crime as a rational choice, the Positivist School shifted the focus to the criminal offender themselves. This led to the development of theories that sought to explain crime by looking at the **individual characteristics** of the offender. These theories can be broadly divided into two categories: **Biological Theories**, which look for causes in a person's physical or genetic makeup, and **Psychological Theories**, which look for causes in a person's personality, mind, and experiences. This module will explore some of the most influential biological and psychological theories of crime.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Describe the core ideas of early biological theories, including Lombroso's concept of the "atavistic man."
- Understand modern biological approaches to crime, such as genetics and neurocriminology.
- Explain the basic principles of Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory of crime.
- Describe how Behavioral and Cognitive learning theories explain the acquisition of criminal behavior.
- Understand the concept of the "psychopathic personality."


## II. Psychological Theories of Crime

Psychological theories look for the causes of crime within the individual's mind, personality, and learning processes.

### A. Psychoanalytic Theory (Sigmund Freud)
- **Sigmund Freud (1856-1939):** The founder of psychoanalysis. While not a criminologist, his theories were influential.
- **The Structure of Personality:** Freud proposed that the personality consists of three parts:
    1.  **The Id:** The primitive, instinctual part of the personality that operates on the "pleasure principle," seeking immediate gratification of its desires (sex, aggression). It is the "devil on your shoulder."
    2.  **The Superego:** The moral part of the personality (the conscience) that internalizes the rules and values of society. It is the "angel on your shoulder."
    3.  **The Ego:** The rational part of the personality that operates on the "reality principle." It tries to mediate between the demands of the Id and the constraints of the Superego.
- **Criminality as a Weak Superego:** From a Freudian perspective, crime is the result of a weak or underdeveloped **superego**. An individual with a weak conscience is unable to control the primitive, antisocial impulses of the Id, leading them to commit crimes. This weak superego is often the result of poor parenting or a lack of proper socialization in early childhood.

### B. Behavioral Theories (Learning Theories)
Behavioral theories argue that criminal behavior is **learned**, not innate.

1.  **Behaviorism (B.F. Skinner):**
    - Argues that all behavior is shaped by its consequences: **reinforcement** and **punishment**.
    - Behavior that is reinforced (rewarded) is more likely to be repeated. Behavior that is punished is less likely to be repeated.
    - **Criminal Behavior:** A person commits a crime because they have learned that it leads to a reward (e.g., money, status) and that the punishments are either unlikely or not severe enough to matter.

2.  **Social Learning Theory (Albert Bandura):**
    - Bandura argued that behavior can also be learned through **observation and modeling**.
    - People, especially children, learn aggressive and criminal behavior by watching others, either in person (e.g., an abusive parent) or through the media (e.g., violent movies and video games).
    - **Bobo Doll Experiment:** Bandura's famous experiment showed that children who watched an adult aggressively beat up a "Bobo doll" were much more likely to imitate that aggressive behavior themselves.

### C. Cognitive Theories
Cognitive theories focus on how people's **thoughts, beliefs, and moral reasoning** affect their behavior.
- **Cognitive Development Theory (Lawrence Kohlberg):** Kohlberg argued that people progress through different stages of moral development. Many criminals, he suggested, are stuck at a low level of moral reasoning, where they only consider the immediate selfish consequences of their actions and are unable to appreciate concepts like justice or the rights of others.

### D. Personality and Crime (The Psychopath)
- This approach looks for the cause of crime in a specific personality type or disorder.
- **The Psychopath (or Sociopath):** The most studied personality type in criminology. Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by a collection of traits:
    - **Lack of Empathy and Guilt:** The inability to feel for others or to feel remorse for their actions.
    - **Egocentricity:** A grandiose sense of self-worth.
    - **Impulsivity and Poor Self-Control.**
    - **Superficial Charm and Manipulativeness.**
- Not all psychopaths are criminals, but they are disproportionately represented among chronic and violent offenders because they lack the internal emotional controls that prevent most people from harming others.
