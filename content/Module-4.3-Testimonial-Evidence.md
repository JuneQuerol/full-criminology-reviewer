# Module 4.3: Testimonial Evidence

This module covers the rules and principles governing testimonial evidence in the Philippines, a crucial area for the Criminology Board Examination.

## I. Definition of Testimonial Evidence

**Testimonial Evidence** is a type of evidence consisting of the sworn statement or declaration of a witness, offered to prove or disprove a fact in issue. It is evidence elicited from the mouth of a witness, as distinguished from real and documentary evidence. This is the most common form of evidence presented in court.

## II. Competency and Qualifications of a Witness

The **competency of a witness** refers to their legal fitness or ability to testify in a judicial proceeding.

**General Rule:** Every person is presumed competent to be a witness. Under Section 20, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, all persons who can perceive, and perceiving, can make known their perception to others, may be witnesses.

**Factors that DO NOT automatically disqualify a witness:**
*   Religious or political belief
*   Interest in the outcome of the case
*   Conviction of a crime (unless otherwise provided by law)

## III. Disqualification of Witnesses

While the rule on competency is broad, the law provides for specific disqualifications based on certain grounds.

### A. Disqualification by Reason of Mental Incapacity or Immaturity (Sec. 21, Rule 130)
1.  **Mental Incapacity:** Those whose mental condition, at the time of their production for examination, is such that they are incapable of intelligently making known their perception to others.
2.  **Immaturity:** Children whose mental maturity is such as to render them incapable of perceiving the facts respecting which they are examined and of relating them truthfully. (Note: The court determines the competency of a child witness through a *voir dire* examination).

### B. Disqualification by Reason of Marriage (Spousal Immunity) (Sec. 22, Rule 130)
*   **Rule:** During the marriage, the husband or the wife cannot be compelled to testify for or against the other without the consent of the affected spouse.
*   **Exceptions:**
    1.  In a civil case by one against the other.
    2.  In a criminal case for a crime committed by one against the other or the latter's direct descendants or ascendants.

### C. Disqualification by Reason of Death or Insanity (Dead Man's Statute) (Sec. 23, Rule 130)
*   **Rule:** Parties or assignors of parties to a case, or persons in whose behalf a case is prosecuted, against an executor, administrator, or representative of a deceased person, or against a person of unsound mind, cannot testify as to any matter of fact occurring *before* the death of such deceased person or before such person became of unsound mind.
*   **Purpose:** To protect the estate of the deceased or the person of unsound mind from fictitious claims.

### D. Disqualification by Reason of Privileged Communication (Sec. 24, Rule 130)
The following persons cannot testify as to matters learned in confidence in the following cases:
1.  **Spousal Privilege:** The husband or the wife, during or after the marriage, cannot be examined without the consent of the other as to any communication received in confidence by one from the other during the marriage.
2.  **Attorney-Client Privilege:** An attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined as to any communication made by the client to him, or his advice given thereon in the course of, or with a view to, professional employment.
3.  **Physician-Patient Privilege:** A person authorized to practice medicine, surgery or obstetrics cannot, in a civil case, without the consent of the patient, be examined as to any advice or treatment given by him or any information which he may have acquired in attending such patient in a professional capacity.
4.  **Priest-Penitent Privilege:** A minister or priest cannot, without the consent of the person making the confession, be examined as to any confession made to or any advice given by him in his professional character in the course of discipline enjoined by the church to which the minister or priest belongs.
5.  **Public Officer's Privilege:** A public officer cannot be examined during his term of office or afterwards, as to communications made to him in official confidence, when the court finds that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure.

## IV. Examination of a Witness

The testimony of a witness is elicited through a series of questions in a prescribed order.

1.  **Direct Examination:** The examination-in-chief of a witness by the party presenting him on the facts relevant to the issue.
2.  **Cross-Examination:** Upon the termination of the direct examination, the witness may be cross-examined by the adverse party as to any matters stated in the direct examination, or connected therewith. Its purpose is to test the witness's accuracy, truthfulness, and freedom from interest or bias.
3.  **Redirect Examination:** After the cross-examination, the witness may be re-examined by the party calling him, to explain or supplement his answers given during the cross-examination.
4.  **Recross-Examination:** Upon the conclusion of the redirect examination, the adverse party may recross-examine the witness on matters stated in his redirect examination, and also on such other matters as may be allowed by the court in its discretion.

## V. Impeachment of a Witness

**Impeachment** is the process of discrediting a witness by attacking their credibility. Under Section 11, Rule 132, a witness may be impeached by the party against whom he was called, by:

1.  **Contradictory evidence** from other sources.
2.  Evidence that his **general reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity is bad**.
3.  Evidence that he has made at other times **statements inconsistent with his present testimony** (prior inconsistent statements).

**Laying the Predicate:** Before a witness can be impeached by evidence of prior inconsistent statements, the statements must be related to him, with the circumstances of the times and places and the persons present, and he must be asked whether he made such statements, and if so, allowed to explain them.

A party generally cannot impeach his own witness, except:
1.  When the witness is an unwilling or hostile witness.
2.  When the witness is an adverse party.
