## 2. CRIMES AGAINST LIBERTY (Art. 267-278)

### A. KIDNAPPING AND SERIOUS ILLEGAL DETENTION (Art. 267)

*   **Definition:** The crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention is committed by any private individual who kidnaps or detains another, or in any other manner deprives him of his liberty.

*   **Elements:**
    1.  The offender is a **private individual**. (If a public officer, the crime is Arbitrary Detention under Art. 124).
    2.  He **kidnaps or detains** another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty.
    3.  The act of detention or kidnapping is **illegal**.

*   **Four Qualifying Circumstances (Penalty is elevated to Death, as per R.A. 7659):**
    1.  If the kidnapping or detention lasts for **more than three (3) days**.
    2.  If it is committed **simulating public authority**.
    3.  If any **serious physical injuries** are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained, or if **threats to kill** him are made.
    4.  If the person kidnapped or detained is a **minor, except when the accused is any of the parents, female, or a public officer**.

*   **Ransom, Killing, Torture (Also qualifying and elevate the penalty):**
    *   If the purpose of the kidnapping is to extort **ransom** from the victim or any other person, the penalty is death, even if none of the circumstances above are present.
    *   If the victim is **killed or dies** as a consequence of the detention, or is subjected to **rape or torture**, the penalty is death.

*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua to death.

### B. SLIGHT ILLEGAL DETENTION (Art. 268)

*   **When Committed:** This is a watered-down version of Serious Illegal Detention. It is committed by a private individual who deprives another of liberty, but **none of the four qualifying circumstances** mentioned in Art. 267 are present.
*   **Key Factor:** The absence of the qualifying circumstances is what makes the crime slight.
*   **Voluntary Release:** If the offender voluntarily releases the person detained within **three (3) days** without having attained his purpose and before the institution of criminal proceedings, the penalty is lower.

### C. UNLAWFUL ARREST (Art. 269)

*   **Definition:** This crime is committed by any person who, in any case other than those authorized by law, or without reasonable ground therefor, shall arrest or detain another for the purpose of delivering him to the proper authorities.
*   **Purpose is Key:** The offender's intent is to bring the victim to the authorities, distinguishing it from illegal detention where the intent is simply to deprive the victim of liberty.

### D. KIDNAPPING OF MINOR (Art. 270-271)

*   **Kidnapping and Failure to Return a Minor (Art. 270):** The penalty of reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon any person who, being entrusted with the custody of a minor person, shall deliberately fail to restore the latter to his parents or guardians.
*   **Inducing a Minor to Abandon His Home (Art. 271):** This is committed by anyone who shall induce a minor to abandon the home of his parents or guardians or the persons entrusted with his custody.

### E. SLAVERY AND EXPLOITATION (Art. 272-274)

*   **Slavery (Art. 272):** Committed by anyone who shall purchase, sell, kidnap, or detain a human being for the purpose of enslaving him.
*   **Exploitation of Child Labor (Art. 273):** The crime of imposing upon a child, under conditions prejudicial to his health or morals, tasks that are excessive.
*   **Services Rendered Under Compulsion (Art. 274):** This refers to compelling a debtor to work for a creditor against his will as security for a debt.

## 3. CRIMES AGAINST SECURITY

### A. GRAVE THREATS (Art. 282)

*   **Two Forms:**
    1.  Threatening another with the infliction upon his **person, honor, or property**, or that of his family, of any wrong amounting to a crime, and demanding money or imposing any other condition, even though not unlawful.
    2.  Making such a threat without imposing a condition.
*   **Elements (First Form):**
    1.  Offender threatens another with the infliction of a wrong amounting to a crime.
    2.  The threat is made subject to a condition.
    3.  The offended party is a person, or his honor or property, or that of his family.

### B. LIGHT THREATS (Art. 283)

*   This is committed when the threat of a wrong does **not** amount to a crime, but a demand for money or other condition is imposed.

### C. OTHER LIGHT THREATS (Art. 285)

*   This includes:
    1.  Threatening another with a weapon, or drawing such weapon in a quarrel, unless it be in lawful self-defense.
    2.  Orally threatening another with some harm not constituting a crime, in the heat of anger.

### D. GRAVE COERCION (Art. 286)

*   **Elements:**
    1.  That a person is prevented by another from doing something not prohibited by law, or compelled to do something against his will, be it right or wrong.
    2.  That the prevention or compulsion is effected by violence, threats, or intimidation.
    3.  That the person who restrains the will and liberty of another has no authority of law.
*   **Core Idea:** Using violence or intimidation to compel someone to do something against their will or to prevent them from doing something lawful.

### E. LIGHT COERCION (Art. 287)

*   **Unjust Vexation:** This is a catch-all offense for any human conduct which, although not productive of some physical or material harm, unjustly annoys or vexes an innocent person. The paramount question is whether the offender's act caused annoyance, irritation, torment, distress, or disturbance to the mind of the person to whom it is directed.

### F. OTHER COERCIONS (Art. 288-289)

*   These articles deal with specific coercions, such as a creditor employing violence to collect from his debtor.

## 4. DISCOVERING SECRETS AND VIOLATING PRIVACY

*   **Revelation of Industrial Secrets (Art. 291):** The person in charge, employee or workman of any manufacturing or industrial establishment who, to the prejudice of the owner thereof, shall reveal the secrets of the industry of the latter shall be punished.
*   **Trespass to Dwelling (Art. 280):** Committed by a private person who shall enter the dwelling of another against the latter's will. The prohibition may be express or implied.
*   **Other Forms of Trespass (Art. 281):** This refers to entering the fenced premises of another or hunting or fishing in such grounds, against the express prohibition of the owner.

| Feature             | Kidnapping / Serious Illegal Detention (Art. 267) | Slight Illegal Detention (Art. 268) | Arbitrary Detention (Art. 124) |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Offender**        | Private Individual                              | Private Individual                  | Public Officer                         |

## 6. Important Notes and Case Examples

*   **Case Example (Kidnapping for Ransom):** In *People v. Anticamara*, the Supreme Court affirmed that the gravamen of the crime of kidnapping for ransom is the deprivation of liberty for the purpose of extorting ransom. It is not necessary that the ransom be actually paid. The mere demand is sufficient.
*   **Arbitrary vs. Illegal Detention:** The key distinction is the offender. If a police officer detains you without a warrant and not under circumstances of a valid warrantless arrest, it's Arbitrary Detention. If a security guard locks you in a room, it's Illegal Detention.
*   **Unjust Vexation:** This crime is a "form of light coercion which is broad enough to include any human conduct which, although not productive of some physical or material harm, would unjustly annoy or irritate an innocent person." (e.g., cutting off someone's electricity or water supply to annoy them).
