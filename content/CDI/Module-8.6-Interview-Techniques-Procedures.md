## I. The Basics of Interviewing

- **Purpose:** To gather information, not to get a confession.
- **Subject:** A witness, victim, or any person who may have helpful information.
- **Tone:** Conversational, informal, and relaxed. The investigator's job is to be a good listener.
- **Environment:** Can be conducted at any location, but a quiet place free from distractions is ideal.

### The Ideal Interview Environment
- **Privacy:** The interview should be conducted in a place where the witness feels comfortable and will not be overheard. This prevents them from being embarrassed or afraid of what others might think.
- **Timing:** Conduct the interview as soon as possible after the event, while the witness's memory is still fresh.
- **Setting:** A familiar setting, like the witness's home or office, can help them feel more relaxed than a formal police station interview room.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Know-Nothing Witness** | Claims to have seen or heard nothing. May be afraid to get involved or may genuinely not know anything. | Build rapport. Reassure them of their safety. Try to jog their memory with specific questions. |
| **Disinterested Witness** | Apathetic and uncooperative. They feel the crime is "not their problem." | Appeal to their sense of civic duty. Emphasize the importance of their information, no matter how small. |
| **Honest Witness** | The ideal witness. They are cooperative and want to provide all the information they have, to the best of their ability. | Be a good, patient listener. Use open-ended questions to let them tell their story. |
| **Deceitful Witness** | A witness who is deliberately lying or withholding information, perhaps to protect themselves or someone else. | Be patient and listen to their whole story. Then, go back and ask specific, probing questions about inconsistencies. |
| **Timid / Child Witness** | May be shy, nervous, or frightened by the process. | Be patient, friendly, and non-threatening. For a child, get down to their eye level and use simple, non-leading questions. |
| **Talkative / Boastful Witness**| Eager to talk and may provide a lot of information, but it may be exaggerated or irrelevant. | Patiently listen, then gently guide them back to the specific topic. Separate fact from their opinion and speculation. |

## IV. The Cognitive Interview Technique

The **Cognitive Interview** is a scientifically-designed method of interviewing that is based on principles of memory and psychology. Its goal is to maximize the quantity and quality of information recalled by a witness, particularly for complex events.

**The Four Main Techniques (Mnemonics):**

1.  **Reconstruct the Context:**
    - The investigator asks the witness to recreate the context of the original event in their mind.
    - *"Think back to the day of the event. What were you doing? What was the weather like? How were you feeling at the time?"*
    - **Purpose:** This helps trigger memory by reinstating the environmental and emotional context of the event.

2.  **Report Everything:**
    - The investigator instructs the witness to report every single detail they can remember, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem.
    - *"Don't leave anything out, even if you think it's not important."*
    - **Purpose:** Small, seemingly irrelevant details can be crucial pieces of the puzzle or can trigger the recall of more significant memories.

3.  **Change the Order:**
    - The investigator asks the witness to recall the event in a different chronological order.
    - *"Tell me what happened, but start from the end and go backwards."* or *"Start from the moment the shot was fired."*
    - **Purpose:** This breaks the witness out of a pre-scripted or rehearsed narrative and can uncover new details.

4.  **Change Perspective:**
    - The investigator asks the witness to try to recall the event from a different perspective.
    - *"Imagine you were standing across the street. What would you have seen from there?"* or *"Try to remember it from the victim's point of view."*
    - **Purpose:** This encourages the witness to access their memory through a different mental pathway, which can lead to new recollections.

The Cognitive Interview is a powerful technique that has been shown to elicit significantly more information from cooperative witnesses than a standard police interview.

## Introduction

The **interview** is one of the most common and essential tools of a criminal investigator. It is a conversation with a purpose: to obtain information from someone who has knowledge that may be of value to an investigation. Unlike an interrogation, an interview is non-accusatory and is designed to build rapport with a witness or victim to elicit the most accurate and complete information possible. The ability to conduct a good interview is a skill that requires planning, psychological insight, and the use of specific techniques. This module covers the procedures and techniques for conducting effective investigative interviews.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Differentiate between an interview and an interrogation.
- Describe the ideal setting and conditions for conducting an interview.
- Identify different types of witnesses and the challenges they may present.
- Explain the three main phases of an interview.
- Describe the steps and purpose of the Cognitive Interview technique.


## II. Types of Witnesses

Investigators will encounter many different types of people during an investigation. Understanding a witness's potential motivations and limitations is key to evaluating their testimony.

## III. The Three Phases of an Interview

A structured interview generally follows three stages.

### Phase 1: Preparation and Planning
- The investigator should review all available information about the case before the interview.
- Prepare a basic outline of the topics to be covered.
- Check the witness's background to be aware of any potential biases or credibility issues.

### Phase 2: The Interview Itself
1.  **Introduction and Rapport Building:**
    - The investigator introduces themselves, shows their credentials, and states the purpose of the interview.
    - The first few minutes should be spent building rapport with "small talk" to put the witness at ease.
2.  **Narrative Phase (Free Recall):**
    - The investigator asks a broad, open-ended question like, **"Tell me in your own words what happened."**
    - The investigator's job here is to **listen actively** and not interrupt. This allows the witness to tell their story in a way that is natural to them and may reveal details the investigator wouldn't have thought to ask about.
3.  **Question-and-Answer Phase (Probing):**
    - After the free narrative, the investigator goes back over the story and asks specific questions to clarify details, resolve inconsistencies, and obtain more information.
    - **Open-ended Questions:** "What happened next?" "Can you describe the car?"
    - **Closed-ended Questions:** "What color was the car?" "Was he tall or short?"
    - Avoid **Leading Questions** that suggest an answer (e.g., "The car was red, wasn't it?").
4.  **Closing:**
    - The investigator summarizes the key points of the witness's statement to ensure it was understood correctly.
    - The investigator thanks the witness for their time and asks, "Is there anything else you think I should know?"
    - Provide contact information in case the witness remembers something later.

### Phase 3: Post-Interview
- The investigator should immediately write up their notes or report while the interview is still fresh in their mind.
- Evaluate the information obtained and compare it with other evidence in the case.


## Conclusion

A successful investigative interview is far more than a simple question-and-answer session. It is a planned, deliberate, and psychologically-aware process. By understanding the dynamics of communication, building rapport, and using structured techniques like the Cognitive Interview, an investigator can unlock a witness's memory and obtain the detailed, accurate information needed to move an investigation forward. The skill of listening is often more important for an interviewer than the skill of talking.
