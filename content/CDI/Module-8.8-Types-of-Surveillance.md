# Module 8.8: Types of Surveillance

## Introduction

**Surveillance**, in the context of criminal investigation, is the covert (secret) and continuous observation of persons, places, or things to obtain information concerning the activities and identities of individuals. It is a proactive investigative tool used when traditional methods are not sufficient. The goal of surveillance is to see without being seen, to listen without being heard. This module will cover the purpose of surveillance and explore its main types: fixed, mobile, and electronic.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define surveillance and state its primary objectives.
- Differentiate between fixed/stationary surveillance and mobile/moving surveillance.
- Describe various methods of mobile surveillance (foot, vehicle).
- Understand the basics of electronic surveillance.
- Recognize the legal and privacy issues associated with surveillance.

## I. The Purpose of Surveillance

Investigators conduct surveillance to achieve a variety of objectives:

- **To obtain evidence of a crime.** (e.g., watching a drug deal happen).
- **To locate a wanted person or a missing person.**
- **To identify the associates and confederates of a suspect.**
- **To verify the reliability of an informant's information.**
- **To gain information for a future interrogation.**
- **To develop probable cause for a search warrant.**
- **To prevent the commission of a crime.**

**Terminology:**
- **Subject:** The person, place, or thing being watched.
- **Surveillant:** The investigator conducting the surveillance.

## II. Fixed Surveillance (Stakeout)

Also known as a **stakeout**, this type of surveillance involves observing the subject from a stationary, hidden position.

- **Method:** The surveillant remains in one location, such as a parked car, a rented room, or a concealed observation post (OP).
- **Purpose:** To monitor activities at a specific location, such as a suspect's house, a known drug den, or a meeting place for criminals.
- **Advantages:**
    - It is relatively easy to conduct with minimal personnel.
    - It is less likely to be detected by the subject than mobile surveillance.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - It is ineffective if the subject becomes mobile and leaves the area.
    - The surveillant can become bored and lose focus over long periods.

**Equipment:** A stakeout often requires specialized equipment, including binoculars or spotting scopes, cameras with telephoto lenses, and night vision devices.

## III. Mobile Surveillance (Tailing or Shadowing)

This type of surveillance involves following a subject who is on the move.

### A. Foot Surveillance (Shadowing)
- **Method:** Following a subject on foot. This requires a team of surveillants to be effective without being detected.
    - **One-Man Shadow:** Very difficult and easily detected. Used only for short distances.
    - **Two-Man Shadow:** More effective. The lead surveillant (A) follows the subject, and the second surveillant (B) follows behind them, acting as a backup.
    - **Three-Man Shadow (The "ABC" Method):** The most effective method.
        - **"A"** follows the subject.
        - **"B"** follows "A".
        - **"C"** walks on the opposite side of the street, keeping pace with the subject.
        - The positions can be rotated to avoid detection.
- **Challenges:** The subject may try to determine if they are being followed by suddenly stopping, looking in reflective windows, or reversing direction. The surveillance team must be prepared for these "countersurveillance" techniques.

### B. Vehicular Surveillance (Tailing)
- **Method:** Following a subject in a vehicle. Like foot surveillance, this is best done with a team of multiple vehicles.
    - **One-Car Tail:** Very risky. The surveillant's car is always behind the subject's, making it easy to spot.
    - **Two-Car Tail:** The lead car follows the subject, and the second car follows the lead car, able to take over the lead position at intervals.
    - **Three-Car Tail:** The most effective method, allowing for rotation of the lead car and for cars to "leapfrog" each other to avoid being directly behind the subject for too long.
- **Challenges:** Losing the subject in heavy traffic, at red lights, or due to fast or evasive driving. It requires excellent communication and coordination between the surveillance vehicles.

**Board Exam Tip:** Understand the ABC method for foot surveillance and the principle of using multiple cars and rotating positions for vehicular surveillance. The goal is always to follow the subject without them knowing they are being followed.

## IV. Electronic Surveillance

This type of surveillance involves the use of electronic devices to monitor conversations, communications, or movements.

### A. Wiretapping and Bugging
- **Wiretapping:** The interception of telephone or other electronic communications (e.g., text messages, emails).
- **Bugging:** The use of a hidden microphone (a "bug") or listening device to monitor conversations inside a room or a car.
- **Legal Requirements:** In the Philippines, this is the most legally restricted form of surveillance. **Republic Act 4200 (The Anti-Wiretapping Act)** makes it illegal for any person, without the consent of all parties involved, to tap any wire or cable or to use any other device to secretly overhear or record a private communication.
- **Exception:** Law enforcement can only conduct wiretapping with a **written order from a competent court**, and only for specific serious crimes such as treason, espionage, rebellion, and kidnapping. Any evidence obtained without a court order is inadmissible.

### B. GPS Tracking
- **Method:** Placing a small, hidden GPS tracking device on a suspect's vehicle. This allows investigators to track the vehicle's movements in real-time without having to physically follow it.
- **Legal Status:** The legality of warrantless GPS tracking is a complex and evolving area of law. In many jurisdictions, including the US (which influences Philippine jurisprudence), attaching a tracker to a vehicle is considered a "search" and therefore requires a warrant.

### C. Video Surveillance (CCTV)
- **Method:** The use of overt (visible) or covert (hidden) video cameras to monitor a location.
- **Overt CCTV:** Cameras in public places, banks, and stores act as a deterrent and provide evidence after a crime.
- **Covert Video:** Hidden "pinhole" cameras can be installed (usually with a warrant) to monitor criminal activity inside a specific location.

## V. Technical Surveillance

This is a broad category that includes any specialized technical methods used to gather information.
- **Binoculars/Telescopes:** For long-distance observation.
- **Night Vision Goggles:** To see in low-light conditions.
- **Thermal Imaging:** To detect heat signatures, which can indicate the presence of people inside a building.
- **Parabolic Microphone:** A long-distance microphone used to listen to conversations from far away.

## Conclusion

Surveillance is a powerful investigative technique that allows police to gather information they could not obtain by any other means. It requires immense patience, skill, and teamwork. From a simple stakeout to a complex, multi-car rolling tail, the goal is always the same: to observe the subject's activities without alerting them to the fact that they are being watched. While effective, surveillance, particularly electronic surveillance, raises significant privacy concerns. Therefore, it must always be conducted with a full understanding of, and in strict compliance with, the legal boundaries that protect a citizen's right to privacy.
