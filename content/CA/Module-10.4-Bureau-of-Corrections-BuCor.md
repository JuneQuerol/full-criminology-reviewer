## Conclusion

The Bureau of Corrections holds the critical responsibility of managing offenders who have committed the most serious crimes in the Philippines. Its mandate is twofold: to securely hold these individuals to protect society, and to provide them with the means to reform themselves. Through its network of seven distinct penal institutions, from the high walls of the New Bilibid Prison to the open fields of the Iwahig Penal Colony, BuCor attempts to balance the often-competing goals of punishment and rehabilitation. The modernization efforts under RA 10575 aim to transform the Bureau into a more effective and humane correctional agency, capable of truly reforming those under its care.

## III. The Seven Prison and Penal Farms of BuCor

BuCor does not operate just one prison. It manages a network of seven facilities located across the Philippines. This dispersal helps to relieve congestion and allows for the segregation of prisoners based on their security classification.

1.  **New Bilibid Prison (NBP) - Muntinlupa City:**
    - This is the main and most well-known prison facility in the country.
    - It houses the **Maximum Security Compound** (for the most dangerous offenders), the **Medium Security Compound** (Camp Sampaguita), and the **Minimum Security Compound** (Camp Bukang Liwayway).
    - It also contains the **Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC)** for newly arrived national prisoners.

2.  **Correctional Institution for Women (CIW) - Mandaluyong City:**
    - This is the only national prison facility dedicated solely to the confinement of female offenders.
    - A newer facility, the Correctional Institution for Women - Mindanao, has also been established.

3.  **Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm - Puerto Princesa, Palawan:**
    - One of the most famous "open" penal colonies in the world.
    - It is a vast, minimum-security facility where inmates are allowed to live with their families in a farming community and work on the penal farm. It is a model for inmate rehabilitation through agriculture.

4.  **San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm - Zamboanga City:**
    - Founded in 1870, it is the oldest operating penal institution in the country.
    - It was originally established to confine political prisoners during the Spanish colonial era.

    - Another open-air penal farm, similar to Iwahig.
    - It is a major producer of rice for the entire Bureau of Corrections.

6.  **Davao Prison and Penal Farm (formerly Tagum Penal Colony) - Panabo, Davao del Norte:**
    - A major agricultural facility, known for its extensive abaca and banana plantations.
    - It was established during the American period to address the increasing number of prisoners.

7.  **Leyte Regional Prison - Abuyog, Leyte:**
    - The newest of the seven facilities, established in the 1970s.
    - It was created to serve the growing inmate population in the Visayas region.

**Board Exam Tip:** You should be able to name the seven penal institutions under BuCor and know their general location and key characteristics.


## V. The Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC)

The RDC is a crucial first step in the correctional process for a national prisoner.
- **Location:** The main RDC is located at the New Bilibid Prison.
- **Purpose:** When a prisoner is first committed to BuCor, they are sent to the RDC for a period of **approximately 60 days**. During this time, they undergo a series of examinations to determine the best rehabilitation program and security classification for them.
- **The Diagnostic Process:**
    - **Medical Examination:** To assess their physical health.
    - **Psychological and Psychiatric Evaluation:** To assess their mental state and personality.
    - **Sociological Examination:** To study their social background and history.
    - **Educational and Vocational Assessment:** To determine their skills and training needs.
- **The Staff Conference:** After the diagnostic process is complete, a "staff conference" is held where all the specialists who examined the inmate meet to discuss their findings and create a personalized treatment plan for the inmate. This plan will then be implemented at the prison where the inmate is ultimately assigned.
