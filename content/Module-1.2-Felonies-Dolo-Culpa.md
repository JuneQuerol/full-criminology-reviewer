# Module 1.2: Felonies - Dolo and Culpa

This module delves into the nature of felonies as defined by the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, focusing on how they are committed either by deceit (dolo) or by fault (culpa). It also covers related crucial concepts such as the stages of execution, criminal liability in cases of mistake, and the nature of impossible crimes, conspiracy, and proposal.

### 1. Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
-   Define a felony and its essential elements under Philippine law.
-   Clearly distinguish between intentional felonies (dolo) and culpable felonies (culpa).
-   Analyze and apply the concepts of `error in personae`, `aberratio ictus`, and `praeter intentionem` to case scenarios.
-   Identify the elements of an impossible crime and its corresponding penalty.
-   Differentiate the consummated, frustrated, and attempted stages of a felony.

### 2. Definition of Felony (Art. 3, RPC)

**Article 3 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC)** defines felonies as **"acts and omissions punishable by law."**

-   **Act:** Any bodily movement which produces an effect in the external world. It is the external manifestation of one's will.
    -   *Example:* Firing a gun at someone.
-   **Omission:** The failure to perform a positive duty which one is bound to do under the law.
    -   *Example:* A mother failing to give sustenance to her infant, leading to the child's death. This is an omission punishable as parricide.

For an act or omission to be considered a felony, it must be punishable by the Revised Penal Code. Crimes punished by special laws are called **offenses**.

---

### 3. How Felonies are Committed

Felonies are committed in two ways:

#### A. By Means of Deceit (Dolo)

This is an **intentional felony**. The act is performed with deliberate intent or malice.

**Elements of Dolo:**
1.  **Freedom:** The offender must have acted on their own volition, without irresistible force or uncontrollable fear.
2.  **Intelligence:** The offender must have the capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their act.
    -   *Exempting circumstances:* An insane person or a minor under 15 lacks intelligence and thus has no criminal liability.
3.  **Intent:** The offender has the purpose of committing the crime. This is the **criminal intent**.
    -   **General Intent:** Presumed from the mere act of committing a wrong. For example, in a homicide case, the intent to kill is presumed from the act of stabbing the victim.
    -   **Specific Intent:** An element of a specific felony that the prosecution must prove. For example, in theft, the specific intent is "to gain" (`animus lucrandi`).

#### B. By Means of Fault (Culpa)

This is a **culpable felony**. The injury is not intentional but results from the offender's negligence, imprudence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill.

**Elements of Culpa:**
1.  **Imprudence:** Deficiency in action or failing to take the necessary precaution to avoid injury.
    -   *Example:* Recklessly driving a car at high speed in a crowded area.
2.  **Negligence:** Deficiency in perception or failing to foresee a danger that a reasonable person would have foreseen.
    -   *Example:* A hunter who, without verifying his target, shoots at a moving object in the bushes, killing a person.
3.  **Lack of Foresight:** Inability to predict the harmful results of one's acts.
4.  **Lack of Skill:** Failure to possess the necessary ability or care in a particular task, which causes harm.
    -   *Example:* A surgeon performing an operation without the required skill, leading to the patient's death.

### 4. Intentional Felonies vs. Culpable Felonies

| Basis              | Intentional Felonies (Dolo)                                 | Culpable Felonies (Culpa)                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mental State**   | Act is malicious; done with deliberate intent.              | Act is not malicious; injury is unintentional.                     |
| **Basis of Liability** | Criminal intent (malice).                                   | Negligence, imprudence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill.       |
| **Nature of the Act**| The offender has the intention to cause an injury.          | The offender's action causes injury as a result of a wrongful act. |
| **Example**        | **Homicide:** A person kills another with intent to kill.     | **Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide:** A person is killed in a car accident due to the driver's reckless driving. |

### 5. Mistake in Criminal Law

When a person commits a felony, the resulting crime may not be exactly what they intended.

-   **Error in Personae (Mistake in the Identity of the Victim):**
    -   The offender commits the crime against a person different from the one intended.
    -   *Example:* X wants to kill Y. At night, X sees Z, whom he mistakes for Y, and kills Z.
    -   *Legal Effect:* The penalty for the intended crime is still applied. If the crime committed is different from what was intended, the penalty for the lesser crime is applied in its maximum period (Art. 49, RPC).

-   **Aberratio Ictus (Mistake in the Blow):**
    -   The offender, intending to injure one person, actually inflicts it on another because of a mistake in their aim or blow.
    -   *Example:* X aims his gun at Y but misses, and the bullet hits and kills Z instead.
    -   *Legal Effect:* This results in a complex crime. In the example, X is liable for the complex crime of Homicide (for Z's death) with Attempted Homicide (for the attempt on Y's life). The penalty for the more serious crime is applied in its maximum period.

-   **Praeter Intentionem (Result is Greater Than Intended):**
    -   The resulting consequence is graver than what the offender intended.
    -   *Example:* X punches Y, only intending to cause physical injuries. Y falls, hits his head on the pavement, and dies.
    -   *Legal Effect:* The offender is still liable for the graver crime (Homicide). However, the lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong is a mitigating circumstance (Art. 13, par. 3, RPC).

---

### 6. Impossible Crime (Art. 4, par. 2, RPC)

An impossible crime is an act that would be an offense against persons or property, but its accomplishment is inherently impossible or the means used is inadequate.

**Elements:**
1.  The act performed would be an offense against **persons** (e.g., Homicide, Parricide) or **property** (e.g., Theft, Estafa).
2.  The act was done with **evil intent**.
3.  The accomplishment is **inherently impossible** OR the **means employed is inadequate or ineffectual**.
4.  The act does not constitute a violation of another provision of the RPC.

**Examples:**
-   **Inherent Impossibility:** X stabs a person who is already dead, intending to kill them. The crime of homicide is impossible because the victim is already deceased.
-   **Inadequate Means:** X tries to poison Y by putting a non-lethal amount of poison in his food.
-   **Ineffectual Means:** X tries to kill Y by using sugar, believing it to be a deadly poison.

**Penalty:**
The penalty for an impossible crime, according to Article 59 of the RPC, is **Arresto Mayor** (1 month and 1 day to 6 months) or a fine ranging from **200 to 500 pesos**. The law penalizes the criminal tendency of the offender.

---

### 7. Stages of Execution (Art. 6, RPC)

-   **Consummated:** A felony is consummated when all the elements necessary for its execution and accomplishment are present.
    -   *Example:* X shoots Y, who dies instantly. The crime of Homicide is consummated.

-   **Frustrated:** It is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence, but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes **independent of the will of the perpetrator**.
    -   *Example:* X stabs Y in the chest, which is a mortal wound. Y is rushed to the hospital and survives due to timely medical intervention. The crime is Frustrated Homicide. The cause independent of X's will is the medical help.

-   **Attempted:** The offender commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts, but does **not perform all the acts of execution** which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than their own spontaneous desistance.
    -   *Example:* X aims a gun at Y, but just as he is about to pull the trigger, a police officer tackles and disarms him. The crime is Attempted Homicide.

**Development of a Crime:**
1.  **Internal Acts:** The mere thought or idea of committing a crime. This is never punishable.
2.  **External Acts:**
    -   **Preparatory Acts:** Acts done as a preliminary step to the commission of a crime. Generally not punishable, except when the law specifically penalizes them (e.g., Conspiracy to commit Rebellion).
    -   **Acts of Execution:** The offender begins to carry out the crime. This is the start of the attempted stage.

---

### 8. Conspiracy and Proposal (Art. 8, RPC)

-   **Conspiracy:** A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.
-   **Proposal:** There is a proposal when the person who has decided to commit a felony proposes its execution to some other person or persons.

**General Rule:** As preparatory acts, conspiracy and proposal to commit a crime are **not punishable**.

**Exceptions:** They are punishable only in cases where the law specifically provides a penalty, such as in the following crimes:
-   Treason (Art. 115)
-   Coup d'etat (Art. 136)
-   Rebellion or Insurrection (Art. 136)
-   Sedition (Art. 141)
-   Arson (PD 1613)

#### **Answer Key and Explanations**

1.  **B) Acts and omissions punishable by the Revised Penal Code.**
    *   **Explanation:** Art. 3, RPC explicitly defines felonies as acts and omissions punishable by the code. Offenses are those punished by special laws.

2.  **C) Dolo**
    *   **Explanation:** Dolo is the Spanish term for deceit, which signifies that a felony was committed with deliberate intent or malice.

3.  **D) Negligence**
    *   **Explanation:** Negligence is the element of culpable felonies (culpa), not intentional felonies (dolo). Dolo requires freedom, intelligence, and intent.

4.  **B) Culpable Felony**
    *   **Explanation:** The driver did not intend to hit the pedestrian (no dolo), but the act resulted from his imprudence (driving over the speed limit during a storm), which constitutes culpa.

5.  **C) Consummated Homicide**
    *   **Explanation:** All the acts of execution were performed, and the intended result (death) was achieved.

6.  **C) Aberratio ictus**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a classic case of mistake in the blow, where the offender's act injured someone other than the intended victim.

7.  **C) Impossible Crime**
    *   **Explanation:** The act of injecting the substance was done with evil intent (to kill), but the means used (distilled water) was ineffectual. This fits the definition of an impossible crime.

8.  **C) The felony was actually produced.**
    *   **Explanation:** The core of an impossible crime is that the felony was *not* produced because its accomplishment was inherently impossible or the means were ineffectual.

9.  **B) Frustrated**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the definition of the frustrated stage. The offender has done everything necessary to commit the crime, but an external factor prevents its consummation.

10. **C) In the attempted stage.**
    *   **Explanation:** If the offender voluntarily stops (spontaneous desistance) before performing all acts of execution, there is no attempted felony. Desistance in the frustrated or consummated stage does not negate liability.

11. **D) No crime is committed yet.**
    *   **Explanation:** Robbery is a crime against property. The general rule is that conspiracy to commit a crime is not punishable. Robbery is not one of the exceptions.

12. **C) Praeter intentionem**
    *   **Explanation:** This Latin term directly translates to "beyond the intention" and is used when the consequence of a criminal act is graver than intended.

13. **C) A lifeguard who intentionally refrains from saving a drowning person he is duty-bound to save.**
    *   **Explanation:** An omission is the failure to perform a duty required by law. The lifeguard has a specific legal duty to act.

14. **C) Imprudence or Negligence**
    *   **Explanation:** Culpable felonies are based on fault, which arises from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill, not malice or criminal intent.

15. **A) Frustrated Homicide**
    *   **Explanation:** X performed all the acts of execution (stabbing in a vital area), but the crime was not consummated due to a cause independent of his will (the medical intervention).

16. **C) Conspiracy to commit rebellion.**
    *   **Explanation:** Conspiracy, a preparatory act, is only punished in specific crimes enumerated by law, one of which is rebellion.

17. **C) Attempted Theft**
    *   **Explanation:** Mario commenced the commission of the crime by an overt act (breaking in) but did not perform all acts of execution because he was caught.

18. **C) The offender performs ALL acts of execution in the frustrated stage, but not in the attempted stage.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the primary distinction between the two stages.

19. **B) Culpa, due to negligence.**
    *   **Explanation:** X did not intend to kill a person; the harm resulted from his negligence in failing to identify his target properly. This is a culpable act.

20. **C) It is a mitigating circumstance.**
    *   **Explanation:** Under Art. 13, par. 3 of the RPC, the fact that the offender had no intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed is a mitigating circumstance.

21. **D) Impossible Crime to commit Theft**
    *   **Explanation:** The act of trying to steal from an empty pocket is an impossible crime because the accomplishment (theft) is inherently impossible. The evil intent is present, but there is no object to be stolen. Note: Some jurisprudence leans toward Attempted Theft, but for board exam purposes, this classic scenario is the prime example of an impossible crime.

22. **C) Commits a crime on a person different from the one he intended to victimize.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the definition of `error in personae`, or mistake in identity.

23. **B) Conspiracy to commit sedition.**
    *   **Explanation:** Sedition is one of the exceptions where the law specifically penalizes conspiracy as a crime.

24. **C) Culpa**
    *   **Explanation:** Lack of skill is one of the modalities of fault (culpa), along with negligence and imprudence.

25. **B) An act that has a direct connection to the crime intended to be committed.**
    *   **Explanation:** An overt act must be more than a mere preparatory act; it must be a direct movement towards the consummation of the crime.
