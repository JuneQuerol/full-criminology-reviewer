### What is the primary purpose of forensic photography at a crime scene?

- [ ] To create artistic photos of the scene.
- [x] To create a fair and accurate record of the scene and evidence.
- [ ] To take pictures of suspects.
- [ ] To process film and digital images for court.

> Explanation: The fundamental purpose of crime scene photography is to permanently record the scene as it was found, including all evidence, in a fair and accurate manner.

### In photography, what does "depth of field" refer to?

- [x] The distance between the nearest and farthest objects that appear in acceptably sharp focus.
- [ ] The distance from the camera to the main subject.
- [ ] The sensitivity of the camera's sensor to light.
- [ ] The opening of the lens that allows light to pass through.

> Explanation: Depth of field is a critical concept in photography, determining how much of the scene, from front to back, is in sharp focus. A larger depth of field is often desired in crime scene photos.

### This type of lighting is created by placing the light source at a low angle to the object, creating long shadows that can show texture and details.

- [ ] Front lighting
- [x] Oblique lighting
- [ ] Backlighting
- [ ] Diffused lighting

> Explanation: Oblique lighting is a technique used in both photography and evidence examination (like fingerprints or indented writing) to reveal small details, textures, and impressions by casting shadows.

### What is the purpose of using a scale or ruler in a close-up photograph of evidence?

- [ ] To make the evidence look bigger.
- [x] To allow for accurate sizing and measurement of the evidence later.
- [ ] To provide a point of focus for the camera.
- [ ] To add a reference number to the photograph.

> Explanation: A scale (like a ruler) is placed next to the evidence to provide a reference for its actual size. This is crucial for analysis and for creating 1:1 comparison photographs.

### Which lens would be most appropriate for taking a photograph of a large crime scene area from a distance?

- [ ] Macro lens
- [x] Wide-angle lens
- [ ] Telephoto lens
- [ ] Normal lens

> Explanation: A wide-angle lens has a shorter focal length and a wider field of view, allowing the photographer to capture a larger area of the scene without having to move back significantly.

### The principle that "every contact leaves a trace" is known as:

- [ ] The Principle of Individuality
- [x] Locard's Exchange Principle
- [ ] The Principle of Comparison
- [ ] The Frye Standard

> Explanation: Formulated by Dr. Edmond Locard, this principle is the foundation of forensic science, stating that a perpetrator will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it.

### What are the three fundamental principles of fingerprint identification?

- [ ] A fingerprint is an individual characteristic; it remains unchanged; it has general ridge patterns.
- [x] Permanence, Individuality (or Uniqueness), and Classifiability.
- [ ] Loops, Whorls, and Arches.
- [ ] Ridge ending, bifurcation, and dot.

> Explanation: The core principles for using fingerprints as a means of identification are: 1) Permanence (they don't change over a lifetime), 2) Individuality (no two are the same), and 3) Classifiability (they can be systematically classified).

### The most common type of fingerprint pattern is the:

- [ ] Arch
- [x] Loop
- [ ] Whorl
- [ ] Accidental

> Explanation: Loops account for approximately 60-65% of all fingerprint patterns, making them the most common.

### What are the focal points of a fingerprint pattern around which the ridges are classified?

- [x] Core and Delta
- [ ] Ridge and Furrow
- [ ] Bifurcation and Enclosure
- [ ] Type lines and Pattern area

> Explanation: The core is the approximate center of the pattern, and the delta is the point on a ridge at or nearest to the point of divergence of two type lines. Their presence and location are key to classification.

### A fingerprint pattern with two deltas and at least one ridge making a complete circuit is a:

- [ ] Loop
- [x] Whorl
- [ ] Arch
- [ ] Tented Arch

> Explanation: The presence of two deltas is a characteristic feature of whorl patterns (e.g., plain whorl, central pocket loop whorl, double loop whorl).

### Minutiae points are the specific ridge characteristics used for fingerprint comparison. Which of the following is a type of minutiae?

- [ ] Core
- [ ] Delta
- [x] Bifurcation
- [ ] Furrow

> Explanation: A bifurcation is a minutiae point where a single ridge splits into two. Other examples include ridge endings, islands (dots), and enclosures.

### A latent fingerprint is one that is:

- [ ] Visible to the naked eye.
- [x] Invisible or hidden and requires development to be seen.
- [ ] Made by pressing fingers in a soft material like wax.
- [ ] A digitally captured fingerprint.

> Explanation: Latent prints are impressions left by the friction ridge skin on a surface, such as a tool handle, glass, or door. They are typically invisible and must be made visible through techniques like powdering or chemical processing.

### What is the final step in the ACE-V methodology for fingerprint comparison?

- [ ] Analysis
- [ ] Comparison
- [ ] Evaluation
- [x] Verification

> Explanation: ACE-V stands for Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation, and Verification. Verification is when a second independent examiner repeats the ACE process to confirm the initial conclusion.

### The study of handwriting and typewriting to determine authenticity or authorship is called:

- [ ] Graphology
- [x] Questioned Document Examination
- [ ] Calligraphy
- [ ] Paleography

> Explanation: Questioned Document Examination is the forensic science discipline that pertains to documents that are potentially disputed in a court of law. Graphology, by contrast, is the pseudoscience of predicting personality from handwriting.

### A document created with the intent to defraud is known as a:

- [ ] Questioned Document
- [x] Forged Document
- [ ] Altered Document
- [ ] Simulated Document

> Explanation: Forgery is the process of making, adapting, or imitating objects, statistics, or documents with the intent to deceive.

### An addition to a document after it was originally prepared is called an:

- [ ] Erasure
- [x] Interlineation or Insertion
- [ ] Obliteration
- [ ] Simulation

> Explanation: An insertion or interlineation is the addition of writing or other material between lines or paragraphs or the addition of whole pages to a document.

### What is an "exemplar" in questioned document examination?

- [x] A known, authentic sample of writing used for comparison.
- [ ] A suspected forged signature.
- [ ] The questioned document itself.
- [ ] A piece of equipment used to analyze ink.

> Explanation: Exemplars are legally admissible authentic samples of handwriting, used by a document examiner to compare with the writing on a questioned document.

### The blotting or smearing of ink when a sharp instrument is used to remove writing from paper is known as:

- [ ] Chemical erasure
- [x] Abrasive erasure
- [ ] Ink feathering
- [ ] Obliteration

> Explanation: Abrasive or mechanical erasure involves physically removing writing, which disturbs the paper fibers and often leaves a thinned, rough area that causes new ink to feather or spread.

### This refers to any identifying characteristic of an individual's handwriting, such as slant, spacing, or letter formation.

- [ ] Line quality
- [x] Individual characteristic
- [ ] Class characteristic
- [ ] Pen pressure

> Explanation: Individual characteristics are the unique and specific traits of a person's handwriting that distinguish it from others. Class characteristics are features shared by a group of people.

### Which instrument is used to visualize indented writing?

- [ ] Spectrophotometer
- [x] Electrostatic Detection Apparatus (ESDA)
- [ ] Gas Chromatograph
- [ ] Comparison Microscope

> Explanation: The ESDA is a non-destructive instrument that creates a static charge on the paper, to which a toner is applied. The toner adheres to the indented writing, making it visible.

### The process of overwriting or crossing out writing to make it unreadable is called:

- [ ] Erasure
- [ ] Alteration
- [x] Obliteration
- [ ] Forgery

> Explanation: Obliteration is the act of obscuring writing by overwriting with another writing material like a marker or correction fluid.

### Which part of a camera controls the duration of time that light is allowed to strike the sensor?

- [ ] Aperture
- [x] Shutter
- [ ] Lens
- [ ] ISO setting

> Explanation: The shutter speed determines how long the shutter remains open, controlling the amount of light reaching the sensor and affecting motion blur.

### A fingerprint that has been impressed into a soft surface, such as clay, wax, or paint, is known as a:

- [ ] Latent print
- [x] Plastic print
- [ ] Patent print
- [ ] Visible print

> Explanation: A plastic print is a three-dimensional impression left on a soft surface.

### A fingerprint pattern that enters from one side of the finger, rises in the middle, and exits out the opposite side is an:

- [x] Arch
- [ ] Loop
- [ ] Whorl
- [ ] Accidental Whorl

> Explanation: The plain arch is the simplest fingerprint pattern, characterized by ridges that enter on one side and exit on the other with a wave or rise in the center.

### In questioned document analysis, what is "line quality"?

- [ ] The thickness of the paper.
- [ ] The type of ink used.
- [x] The fluency, smoothness, and continuity of the written strokes.
- [ ] The spacing between words.

> Explanation: Line quality refers to the observable flow and skill of the writer. Forged writing often shows poor line quality, appearing shaky, hesitant, or drawn.

### Which chemical is commonly used to develop latent fingerprints on porous surfaces like paper?

- [x] Ninhydrin
- [ ] Cyanoacrylate (Superglue)
- [ ] Silver Nitrate
- [ ] Iodine

> Explanation: Ninhydrin reacts with the amino acids present in fingerprint residue to produce a purple-colored compound called Ruhemann's purple, making the print visible on paper and other porous surfaces.

### The AFIS database stores what type of information for fingerprint comparison?

- [ ] Full images of all fingerprints on file.
- [x] Digital templates of fingerprint patterns and minutiae points.
- [ ] Criminal histories of individuals.
- [ ] Scanned ten-print cards.

> Explanation: The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) does not store entire images but rather a digital map of the ridge patterns and minutiae points, which allows for rapid searching and comparison.

### Which of the following is considered a class characteristic in handwriting?

- [ ] An unusual "t" crossing.
- [x] The style of writing learned, such as Palmer or Zaner-Bloser.
- [ ] A specific, repeated spelling error.
- [ ] The unique way a letter "g" is formed.

> Explanation: Class characteristics are features shared by a group of individuals, often because they were taught the same writing system. Individual characteristics are the unique deviations from that system.

### What is the first step in a crime scene photographic series?

- [ ] Close-up shots of the evidence.
- [ ] Mid-range shots to show evidence in context.
- [x] Overall, wide-angle shots of the entire scene.
- [ ] Photographs of the victim.

> Explanation: The photographic process should work from the general to the specific: overall views first, then mid-range to show relationships, and finally close-ups of individual items of evidence.

### A signature that is created by copying or tracing an authentic signature is known as a:

- [x] Simulated or traced forgery
- [ ] Freehand forgery
- [ ] Fictitious signature
- [ ] Disguised signature

> Explanation: A simulated forgery is an attempt to imitate the handwriting of another person, while a traced forgery involves following the outline of a genuine signature.
