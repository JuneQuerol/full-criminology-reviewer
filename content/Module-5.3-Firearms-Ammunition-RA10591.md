## 2. Declaration of Policy (Section 2)

The State recognizes the right of its qualified citizens to self-defense through, when it is the reasonable means to repel the unlawful aggression under the circumstances, the use of firearms. However, the State also recognizes the need to regulate firearms and ammunition to ensure public safety and prevent their misuse.

*Sa madaling salita, may KARAPATAN ang mga Pilipino na magmay-ari ng baril para sa self-defense, pero may CONDITIONS at REGULATIONS para sa public safety. Hindi pwedeng basta-basta na lang magdala ng baril.*

---

## 3. Definition of Terms (Section 3)

### A. FIREARM
Any handheld or portable weapon, whether a small arm or light weapon, that expels or is designed to expel a bullet, shot, slug, missile or any projectile, which is discharged by means of expansive force of gases from burning gunpowder or other form of combustion or any similar instrument or implement.

**Classifications:**
1. **Small Arms** - firearms intended to be fired with one or both hands (e.g., pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns).
2. **Light Weapons** - firearms designed for use by two or more persons serving as a crew (e.g., machine guns, mounted grenade launchers).

*Basta mag-eexpel ng bala gamit ang gunpowder, FIREARM yun. Maliit man o malaki.*

### B. AMMUNITION
A complete unfired unit consisting of a bullet, cartridge case, gunpowder/propellant, and primer, or loaded shell for use in any firearm.

*Ito yung "bala" na inilalagay sa baril. Kailangan complete - may bullet, casing, gunpowder, at primer.*

### C. QUALIFIED CITIZEN
A natural-born Filipino citizen at least **twenty-one (21) years old** who has gainful work, business or occupation, or if unemployed, has maintained a fixed abode for at least one year in the locality where he applies for license.

### D. LICENSE TO OWN AND POSSESS FIREARM (LTOPF)
A license issued by the Chief of the PNP to qualified citizens, authorizing them to own and possess a firearm.

### E. PERMIT TO CARRY FIREARM OUTSIDE RESIDENCE (PTCFOR)
A permit issued by the Chief of the PNP authorizing a qualified citizen with a registered firearm to carry it outside of residence.

*Dalawang permit ang kailangan: (1) LICENSE to own/possess (para sa bahay mo), at (2) PERMIT to carry outside (para sa labas ng bahay). Hindi pwedeng license lang!*

---

## 4. Classification of Firearms (Section 3)

### A. FIREARMS SUITABLE FOR SPORTS PURPOSES
- Caliber .22 to .38 rimfire/centerfire revolvers and pistols
- Caliber .22 to 7.62mm rifles and muskets
- 12 gauge or smaller shotguns

- High-powered rifles and pistols (caliber higher than .38)
- Military weapons (e.g., M16, AK47, M14, Garand rifles)

Only qualified citizens who have been issued a License to Own and Possess Firearms (LTOPF).

### B. Requirements for LTOPF
1. Must be a qualified citizen
2. Must file an application with the Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO) of the PNP

### C. Permit to Carry Outside Residence (PTCFOR)

**Exceptions Who May Carry Without PTCFOR:**

- Armed Forces personnel in active service
- Members of armed security agencies while on duty

*Kahit may lisensya ka na, kailangan pa ng special permit para magdala sa labas. Exception lang ang mga pulis, sundalo, at security guards na on duty.*

---

## 6. Offenses and Penalties

### A. UNLAWFUL ACQUISITION, POSSESSION OF FIREARMS (Section 28)

**For Firearms NOT Suitable for Sports:**
- **Penalty:** *Prision mayor* in its medium period (8 yrs 1 day to 10 yrs) to *Reclusion perpetua* (20 yrs 1 day to 40 yrs)
- *Depende sa dami ng baril at circumstances*

**For Firearms Suitable for Sports:**
- **Penalty:** *Prision correccional* in its maximum period (4 yrs 2 mos 1 day to 6 yrs) to *Prision mayor* in its medium period (8 yrs 1 day to 10 yrs)

**Aggravating Circumstances (Heavier Penalty):**
If possession is coupled with:
- Commission of another crime (e.g., murder, robbery)
- Possession by a prohibited person (e.g., drug user, convicted felon)
- Possession of two (2) or more firearms

*Kapag nahuli kang may baril na walang license, malaki ang penalty. Mas mabigat pa kung high-powered firearms, o kung may kasama kang ibang krimen, o kung convicted criminal ka.*

**📌 Board Exam Tip:** Illegal possession is MALA PROHIBITA - good faith is NOT a defense. Kahit sabihin mo "hindi ko alam na bawal," liable ka pa rin!

---

### B. UNLAWFUL MANUFACTURE, IMPORTATION, SALE (Section 29)

**Offense:** Manufacturing, assembling, importing, selling, or distributing firearms or ammunition without proper license or authority.

**Penalty:**
- **For firearms NOT suitable for sports:** *Reclusion temporal* to *Reclusion perpetua* (12 yrs 1 day to 40 yrs)
- **For firearms suitable for sports:** *Prision mayor* to *Reclusion temporal* (6 yrs 1 day to 20 yrs)

*Mas mabigat ang penalty dito kumpara sa simple possession, kasi ikaw ay NAGBEBENTA o GUMAGAWA ng baril illegally.*

---

### C. ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF AMMUNITION (Section 32)

**Penalty:**
- *Prision mayor* in its minimum period (6 yrs 1 day to 8 yrs) if the person is not licensed to possess a firearm
- If the ammunition is for firearms not suitable for sports: Heavier penalty applies

*Kahit bala lang, kapag wala kang license, may kaso ka na!*

---

### D. USE OF LOOSE FIREARM IN COMMISSION OF CRIME (Section 29)

If an unlicensed firearm is used in the commission of a crime, **the penalty for illegal possession is imposed as an additional penalty**, irrespective of the other crime committed.

**Example:**
- Pedro kills Juan using an unlicensed .45 caliber pistol.
- Pedro is liable for:
  1. **Murder** (or Homicide, depending on circumstances)
  2. **PLUS Illegal Possession of Firearms** as a separate offense

*Dalawang kaso ang haharapin mo: yung krimen mismo (murder/robbery) PLUS yung illegal possession. Parang "bonus penalty."*

**📌 Board Exam Tip:** Under R.A. 10591, illegal possession is a SEPARATE and DISTINCT crime, unlike under the old law (P.D. 1866) where it was merely an aggravating circumstance.

---

### E. PLANTING OF FIREARMS (Section 35)

**Definition:** Any person who plants evidence of firearms, ammunition, or explosives and similar devices upon another person in order to implicate the latter for violation of this Act.

**Penalty:** Same penalty as illegal possession under Section 28

*Ito yung classic "lagay" o "sablay" ng baril. Kapag napatunayang nag-plant ka ng ebidensya, same penalty ang aabutin mo.*

---

### F. FAILURE TO NOTIFY LOST OR STOLEN FIREARM (Section 33)

Any registered firearm owner who fails to report the loss or theft of a registered firearm within **thirty (30) days** from discovery is liable.

**Penalty:** *Prision correccional* in its minimum and medium periods (6 months 1 day to 4 yrs 2 mos)

*Kapag nawala o ninakaw ang baril mo, kailangan mag-report ka within 30 days, o else may kaso ka.*

---

## 7. Exemptions from Licensing

4. **Gunsmiths** duly licensed by the PNP
5. **Juridical persons** (corporations, museums, educational institutions) for purposes authorized by law

*Ang mga pulis, sundalo, at mga may authority lang ang exempt sa licensing requirements.*

---

## 8. Prohibited Persons (Section 32)

The following persons are **PROHIBITED** from owning or possessing any firearm or ammunition:

1. Persons **convicted by final judgment** of a crime involving violence or crimes against public order
2. **Fugitives from justice**
3. Persons **under indictment for a crime** punishable by more than 6 years

5. Persons **suffering from mental disability**
6. Persons **dishonorably discharged** from military or police service
7. Persons under 21 years old (except for minors who are members of shooting clubs)

*Kapag convicted criminal, drug user, o may mental problem ka, BAWAL kang magmay-ari ng baril.*

**📌 Board Exam Tip:** Possession by a PROHIBITED PERSON is an AGGRAVATING circumstance - heavier penalty!

---

## 9. Important Principles and Jurisprudence

### A. Corpus Delicti
For illegal possession of firearms, the **corpus delicti** (body of the crime) consists of:
1. The existence of the firearm
2. The fact that the accused who possessed or owned the firearm does not have the corresponding license or permit

*Dalawang elemento lang: (1) May baril, (2) Walang license. Yun lang!*

### B. Nature of the Crime
Illegal possession of firearms is a **continuing offense**. It is committed as long as the person continues to possess the firearm without the proper license.

### C. Warrantless Arrest
A person caught in **flagrante delicto** (in the act) carrying a firearm may be arrested without a warrant.
