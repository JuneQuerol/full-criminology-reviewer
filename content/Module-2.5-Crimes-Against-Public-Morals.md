## 2. GAMBLING AND BETTING (Art. 195-199)

Gambling, while a socially tolerated activity in some forms, is strictly regulated. The state penalizes unauthorized gambling to curb its negative social and economic effects.

### A. ILLEGAL GAMBLING (Art. 195 as amended by PD 1602 and RA 9287)

*   **Definition:** Illegal gambling involves staking money or any object of value on a game or scheme whose outcome depends wholly or chiefly on chance. It is punishable when conducted without a license or permit from the appropriate government agency.

*   **What constitutes gambling:**
    *   Any game of chance or skill-based game where betting is involved.
    *   **PD 1602 (as amended by RA 9287)** lists various forms, including:
        *   Jueteng, masiao, and other number games.
        *   Cara y cruz, black jack, baccarat, and other card games.
        *   Mahjong (if played with betting).
        *   Horse racing bookies and other sports betting outside authorized outlets.
    *   The law penalizes not just the players, but more heavily the **collectors, agents, coordinators, and maintainers/operators** of the illegal gambling operation.

### B. IMPORTATION, SALE, AND POSSESSION OF LOTTERY TICKETS (Art. 196)

This article penalizes individuals who, without proper authorization, import, sell, or possess lottery tickets or advertisements for lotteries that are not sanctioned by the Philippine government. This includes foreign lottery tickets.

### C. BETTING IN SPORTS (Art. 197)

This article punishes individuals who engage in betting on the results of sports events, such as boxing, basketball, or other athletic competitions. This applies to both the person placing the bet and the person collecting or soliciting bets (bookie).

### D. ILLEGAL COCKFIGHTING (Art. 199)

*   This article penalizes unauthorized cockfighting.
*   **PD 449 (Cockfighting Law of 1974):** This law governs the conduct of cockfighting in the Philippines.
    *   Cockfighting is only legal in licensed cockpits on Sundays, legal holidays, and specific local fiestas (for not more than three days).
    *   Any cockfighting ("tupada") held outside these designated places and times is considered illegal.
    *   The law also penalizes betting with minors and promoting cockfighting for fraudulent purposes.

## 3. OFFENSES AGAINST DECENCY AND GOOD CUSTOMS (Art. 200-202)

These crimes are intended to protect public morality and the established norms of social conduct.

### A. GRAVE SCANDAL (Art. 200)

*   **Elements:**
    1.  The offender performs an act in a public place or within public view.
    2.  The act is highly scandalous as to offend decency and good customs.
    3.  It is not one of the crimes of adultery, concubinage, or acts of lasciviousness.

*   **What constitutes "highly scandalous":** The act must be a notorious violation of decency and morality. It is judged based on the community's standards.
    *   *Example:* A couple engaging in sexual acts in a public park.

### B. IMMORAL DOCTRINES, OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS, AND EXHIBITIONS (Art. 201)

*   **Three acts punished:**
    1.  Publicly expounding or proclaiming doctrines contrary to public morals.
    2.  Authoring, editing, or publishing obscene literature, posters, or other materials.
    3.  Producing, exhibiting, or showing indecent or immoral plays, scenes, acts, or movies.

*   The test for obscenity is whether the material, taken as a whole, has a dominant theme that appeals to prurient interest and is offensive to contemporary community standards.
*   **Anti-Child Pornography Act (RA 9775):** This special law specifically penalizes the production, distribution, and possession of child pornography, with much harsher penalties than Art. 201.

### C. VAGRANCY AND PROSTITUTION (Art. 202, as amended by RA 10158)

*   **RA 10158 (2012) decriminalized vagrancy.** Before this amendment, a person was considered a vagrant if they had no apparent means of subsistence and were found loitering. This is no longer a crime.

*   **Prostitution:** The law now primarily focuses on prostitution.
    *   A prostitute is defined as a woman who, for money or profit, habitually engages in sexual intercourse or lewd acts with various persons.
    *   While the prostitute herself may be penalized, modern jurisprudence and related laws often treat them as victims, focusing prosecution on the pimps, traffickers, and those who exploit them.

---

## 4. RELATED SPECIAL LAWS

These laws provide a more robust and specific framework for addressing modern manifestations of crimes against public morals.

*   **Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364):** Punishes human trafficking, which often involves forcing or deceiving individuals into prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation. It treats victims of trafficking as victims, not criminals.

*   **Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act (RA 9995):** Penalizes the act of taking photos or videos of a person engaged in a private act, or of their private areas, without their consent, and the act of distributing such materials.

*   **Anti-Child Pornography Act (RA 9775):** A specific and stringent law penalizing all activities related to child pornography. It carries severe penalties and mandates protection for child victims.

*   **Cybercrime Prevention Act (RA 10175):** Punishes cybersex, child pornography, and other unsolicited commercial communications. It provides a legal framework for crimes committed using information and communication technologies.

## 5. Important Notes and Updates in Philippine Law

*   **Shift in Focus:** There is a notable legal and societal shift from penalizing the individuals (like prostitutes or vagrants) to targeting the syndicates and individuals who exploit them. Laws like RA 9208 emphasize the vulnerability of victims.
*   **Decriminalization of Vagrancy:** RA 10158 is a landmark amendment, recognizing that poverty should not be criminalized.
*   **Technological Impact:** Laws like RA 9995 and RA 10175 were enacted to address how technology has created new avenues for committing crimes against public morals.
*   **RA 9287:** This law increased the penalties for illegal numbers games, reflecting a stronger stance against organized illegal gambling.
