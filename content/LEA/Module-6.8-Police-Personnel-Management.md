## I. Recruitment and Selection

The goal of recruitment is to attract a large pool of qualified applicants. The goal of selection is to identify the best candidates from that pool.

### A. The Recruitment Process
- **RA 8551:** Sets the minimum qualifications for appointment into the PNP.
    - **Citizenship:** A citizen of the Philippines.
    - **Character:** A person of good moral conduct.
    - **Education:** Must possess a formal baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of learning.
    - **Eligibility:** Must have passed the PNP Entrance Examination (given by NAPOLCOM) or its equivalent.
    - **Age:** Not less than twenty-one (21) nor more than thirty (30) years of age.
    - **Height:** At least 1.62 meters (5'4") for males and 1.57 meters (5'2") for females. (Note: Height requirements can be waived for members of indigenous communities).
    - **Weight:** Must be within the standard weight corresponding to his or her height, age, and sex.

### B. The Selection Process (The "Gauntlet")
Applicants who meet the minimum qualifications must then pass a series of sequential tests. Failure at any stage results in disqualification.

1.  **Preliminary Interview:** Initial screening to check basic qualifications.
2.  **Psychological and Psychiatric Examination (PPE):** To determine the applicant's mental fitness and suitability for police work.
3.  **Complete Character and Background Investigation (CBI):** An extensive check on the applicant's personal life, including interviews with neighbors, teachers, and employers.
4.  **Complete Medical Examination:** A thorough physical and medical exam to ensure the candidate is physically fit for the rigors of training and police work.
5.  **Physical Agility Test:** Tests of strength, endurance, and coordination (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups, running).
6.  **Final Panel Interview:** The applicant faces a board of senior officers who make the final determination on their appointment.

**Board Exam Tip:** Memorize the minimum qualifications under RA 8551. The age and education requirements are frequent exam topics. The "sequential" nature of the selection process is also a key concept.

## III. Performance Evaluation

The PNP uses a formal system to regularly evaluate the performance of its members. This is crucial for making decisions about promotion, assignments, and identifying training needs.

- **PNP Performance Evaluation System:** Rates personnel based on their job performance, accomplishments, and adherence to police ethics and standards.
- **Purpose:**
    - Provides a basis for promotion and salary increases.
    - Identifies underperforming personnel who may need retraining or counseling.
    - Helps commanders make fair and objective decisions about assignments.

## V. Discipline, Grievance, and Separation

Maintaining discipline is critical in a uniformed service. The PNP has a formal system for addressing misconduct and resolving disputes.

### A. Disciplinary Machinery
- The PNP has a multi-layered system for investigating and punishing offenses.
- **Minor Offenses:** Can be handled by the Chief of Police or immediate supervisors (e.g., reprimand, withholding of privileges).
- **Serious Offenses:** Are handled by higher authorities, including the Internal Affairs Service (IAS), the PNP leadership, and NAPOLCOM. Penalties can range from suspension to dismissal from service.

### B. Internal Affairs Service (IAS)
- Created by RA 8551, the IAS is the "police of the police."
- It is an internal watchdog unit that can investigate complaints and misconduct against PNP members *motu proprio* (on its own initiative).
- It helps ensure accountability and integrity within the force.

### C. Grievance System
- The PNP has a mechanism for personnel to air their complaints and grievances regarding management decisions, working conditions, or interpersonal conflicts without fear of reprisal.

### D. Attrition System (RA 8551)
- The system for removing personnel from service due to non-qualification or poor performance. (See Module 6.3 for details on grounds for attrition).

## Introduction

A police organization is only as good as its people. Police Personnel Management, also known as Human Resource Management, is the comprehensive process of managing a police officer's journey from applicant to retiree. It involves attracting the best candidates, providing them with the right training, evaluating their performance, promoting the deserving, and disciplining the errant. This module covers the entire lifecycle of police personnel administration, which is the backbone of building a professional and competent police force.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Outline the steps in the police recruitment and selection process.
- Describe the different phases of police training.
- Explain the purpose and components of the PNP performance evaluation system.
- Identify the requirements and procedures for police promotion.
- Understand the principles of police discipline and the grievance machinery.


## II. Police Training and Development

Once appointed, a new police recruit (Patrolman/Patrolwoman) undergoes a rigorous and multi-phased training program.

### A. The Public Safety Basic Recruit Course (PSBRC)
- This is the foundational, 6-month academic and physical training for all new recruits, conducted at the National Police Training Institute (NPTI).
- It covers basic police subjects, laws, procedures, and instills discipline.

### B. Field Training Program (FTP)
- After graduating from the PSBRC, the new officer undergoes a 12-month on-the-job training program at a police station.
- This is where they apply the theories learned in the academy to real-world police work under the supervision of a Field Training Officer (FTO).
- The FTP is divided into phases, rotating the trainee through different aspects of police work (patrol, traffic, investigation).

### C. Career Courses (Mandatory Schooling)
As officers advance in their careers, they must complete mandatory courses to be eligible for promotion to certain ranks.
- **Officer's Basic Course (OBC):** For promotion to Police Captain.
- **Officer's Advance Course (OAC):** For promotion to Police Major.
- **Officer's Senior Executive Course (OSEC):** For promotion to Police Colonel and higher.


## IV. Promotion System

Promotion in the PNP is the advancement of an officer to a higher rank, position, and salary. The system is designed to be based on merit and fitness.

### A. Requirements for Promotion
- **Time-in-Grade:** The officer must have served a minimum amount of time in their current rank.
- **Education:** Must meet the educational requirements for the new rank.
- **Mandatory Schooling:** Must have completed the required career courses (OBC, OAC, OSEC).
- **Eligibility:** Must have passed the appropriate Promotional Examination administered by NAPOLCOM.
- **Performance:** Must have a satisfactory performance evaluation rating.

### B. Types of Promotion
1.  **Regular Promotion:** The standard promotion process based on meeting all the requirements.
2.  **Special Promotion / Meritorious Promotion:** A police officer may be promoted to the next higher rank for conspicuous acts of courage and gallantry in the line of duty, at the risk of his/her life above and beyond the call of duty. This type of promotion often bypasses some of the standard requirements.


## Conclusion

Police Personnel Management is a dynamic and continuous cycle. It begins with a rigorous selection process to ensure only qualified individuals enter the service. It continues with comprehensive training to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge. Throughout their career, their performance is evaluated, and their advancement is based on a system of merit and fitness. Finally, a robust disciplinary system ensures that all members are held to the highest standards of conduct. A mastery of these HR concepts is essential for understanding how a professional police service is built and maintained.
