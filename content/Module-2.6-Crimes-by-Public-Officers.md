## 2. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC OFFICER

**Who is a public officer?**

Under the Revised Penal Code, a public officer is any person who, by direct provision of the law, popular election, or appointment by a competent authority, shall take part in the performance of public functions in the Government of the Philippine Islands, or shall perform in said Government or in any of its branches public duties as an employee, agent, or subordinate official, of any rank or class.

**Distinction from a private individual:**

The main distinction lies in the nature of the functions performed. A public officer performs public functions and duties, and their actions are imbued with public trust. Crimes committed by public officers often involve an abuse of their official position or a violation of the trust placed in them by the public.

    *   **Elements:**
        1.  The offender is a public officer.
        2.  He accepts an offer or a promise or receives a gift or present by himself or through another.
        3.  Such offer or promise is accepted or gift or present received by the public officer with a view to committing some crime, or in consideration of the execution of an act which does not constitute a crime but is unjust, or to refrain from doing something which it is his official duty to do.
