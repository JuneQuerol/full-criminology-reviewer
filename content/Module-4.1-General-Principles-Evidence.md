# Module 4.1: General Principles of Evidence

## 1. Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to:
- Define Evidence and understand its scope under the Philippine Rules of Court.
- Differentiate between the various types and classifications of evidence.
- Understand the concepts of Burden of Proof and Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt.
- Distinguish between Conclusive and Disputable Presumptions.
- Explain the principles of Judicial Notice and Judicial Admissions.
- Apply these principles to hypothetical criminal case scenarios.

## 2. Definition of Evidence

Under the **Rules of Court (Rule 128, Section 1)**, evidence is defined as the means, sanctioned by these rules, of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a matter of fact.

It is the method by which facts are proved or disproved in court.

## 3. Scope of the Rules of Evidence

The rules of evidence, found in **Rules 128 to 134 of the Rules of Court**, shall be the same in all courts and in all trials and hearings, except as otherwise provided by law or these rules.

- **Rule 128:** General Provisions
- **Rule 129:** What Need Not Be Proved (Judicial Notice and Admissions)
- **Rule 130:** Rules of Admissibility (Object, Documentary, Testimonial Evidence)
- **Rule 131:** Burden of Proof and Presumptions
- **Rule 132:** Presentation of Evidence
- **Rule 133:** Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence
- **Rule 134:** Perpetuation of Testimony

## 4. Types of Evidence

Evidence can be categorized into three main types:

1.  **Object (Real) Evidence:** Evidence that is addressed directly to the senses of the court. It consists of tangible things, like a weapon, clothing, or a photograph.
    *   *Example:* The knife used in a stabbing incident.
2.  **Documentary Evidence:** Evidence supplied by written instruments or derived from conventional symbols, like letters or numbers. It includes writings, recordings, photographs, or any material containing letters, words, sounds, numbers, figures, symbols, or their equivalent.
    *   *Example:* A written confession, a threatening text message, or a CCTV recording.
3.  **Testimonial Evidence:** Evidence given by a witness under oath or affirmation. This is the most common form of evidence.
    *   *Example:* The statement of an eyewitness describing the crime.

## 5. Classification of Evidence

Evidence can be further classified as follows:

-   **Direct vs. Circumstantial Evidence**
    *   **Direct Evidence:** Proves a fact in issue directly without any inference or presumption.
        *   *Example:* A witness testifying that they saw the accused shoot the victim.
    *   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Indirectly proves a fact in issue through an inference which the fact-finder may draw. A series of circumstances may be sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
        *   *Example:* A witness testifying that they saw the accused running from the crime scene holding a bloody knife.

-   **Primary vs. Secondary Evidence**
    *   **Primary Evidence (Best Evidence):** The original document or object itself. The best evidence rule states that the original of a document must be produced whenever its contents are the subject of inquiry.
        *   *Example:* The original signed contract.
    *   **Secondary Evidence (Substitutionary Evidence):** A copy of the original document or testimony regarding its contents. It is admissible only when the original is lost, destroyed, or cannot be produced in court.
        *   *Example:* A photocopy of a lost contract.

## 6. Burden of Proof in Criminal Cases

**Burden of Proof** is the duty of a party to present evidence to establish their claim.

In criminal cases, the **burden of proof rests on the prosecution**. The prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused. The accused has the presumption of innocence and does not have to prove their innocence. This burden never shifts to the accused.

## 7. Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt

This is the standard of proof required in a criminal case for a conviction. It means that the evidence presented must be so conclusive and convincing that it leaves no reasonable doubt in the mind of the judge that the accused is guilty.

It does not mean absolute certainty, but a moral certainty. If there is any reasonable doubt, the accused must be acquitted.

## 8. Presumptions

A **presumption** is an inference as to the existence of a fact not actually known, arising from its usual connection with another which is known.

1.  **Conclusive Presumptions (Presumption Juris et de Jure):** Presumptions that the law does not allow to be contradicted.
    *   *Example (Rule 131, Sec. 2a):* "Whenever a party has, by his own declaration, act, or omission, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true, and to act upon such belief, he cannot, in any litigation arising out of such declaration, act, or omission, be permitted to falsify it." (Estoppel in pais)

2.  **Disputable Presumptions (Presumption Juris Tantum):** Presumptions that are satisfactory if uncontradicted, but may be contradicted and overcome by other evidence.
    *   *Examples (Rule 131, Sec. 3):*
        *   A person is innocent of a crime or wrong.
        *   An unlawful act was done with an unlawful intent.
        *   A person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary act.
        *   Evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced.

## 9. Judicial Notice and Judicial Admissions

-   **Judicial Notice:** The act of a court in recognizing the existence and truth of certain facts without the need of producing evidence. It can be mandatory or discretionary.
    *   **Mandatory Notice:** Laws of the Philippines, official acts of the government, etc.
    *   **Discretionary Notice:** Matters of public knowledge or capable of unquestionable demonstration.

-   **Judicial Admissions:** An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case. It does not require proof.
    *   *Example:* An accused pleading guilty during arraignment. This admission can be used against him.
