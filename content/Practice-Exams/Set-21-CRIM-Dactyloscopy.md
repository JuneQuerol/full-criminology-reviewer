### 1. Which part of the friction skin is responsible for forming the unique ridge patterns used in fingerprint identification?

- [ ] Epidermis
- [x] Dermal papillae
- [ ] Hypodermis
- [ ] Stratum corneum

> **Explanation:** The dermal papillae is the layer of skin between the dermis and epidermis that is responsible for the unique ridge patterns. The epidermis is the outermost layer, while the hypodermis is the deepest. The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis.

### 2. In the Henry Classification System, what is the primary classification of a person with whorls on all ten fingers?

- [ ] 1/1
- [ ] 16/16
- [x] 32/32
- [ ] 1/32

> **Explanation:** The primary classification in the Henry system is a fraction derived from the sum of the values of the whorl-type patterns. Each finger is assigned a value if it has a whorl. The sum of the values of the even-numbered fingers plus one is the numerator, and the sum of the values of the odd-numbered fingers plus one is the denominator. If all fingers have whorls, the calculation is (16+8+4+2+1) + 1 / (16+8+4+2+1) + 1 = 32/32.

### 3. A fingerprint pattern that has two deltas and at least one ridge that makes a complete circuit is a:

- [ ] Loop
- [x] Whorl
- [ ] Arch
- [ ] Tented Arch

> **Explanation:** A whorl is defined by having at least two deltas and a recurving ridge that makes a complete circuit. Loops have one delta, and arches have no deltas.

### 4. What is the term for the study of fingerprint identification?

- [ ] Dactylography
- [x] Dactyloscopy
- [ ] Podoscopy
- [ ] Poroscopy

> **Explanation:** Dactyloscopy is the scientific study of fingerprints as a means of identification. Dactylography is the study of the classification of fingerprints. Podoscopy is the study of footprints, and poroscopy is the study of pores.

### 5. What type of fingerprint pattern is characterized by ridges that enter on one side of the impression and flow or tend to flow out the other with a rise or wave in the center?

- [ ] Loop
- [ ] Whorl
- [x] Plain Arch
- [ ] Tented Arch

> **Explanation:** A plain arch has ridges that enter on one side and exit on the other with a gentle rise. A tented arch has a more pronounced, sharp rise in the center.

### 6. Which of the following is NOT a type of whorl pattern?

- [ ] Plain Whorl
- [ ] Central Pocket Loop Whorl
- [ ] Double Loop Whorl
- [x] Tented Arch Whorl

> **Explanation:** Tented Arch is a separate pattern type and not a sub-category of whorls. The main types of whorls are Plain, Central Pocket Loop, Double Loop, and Accidental.

### 7. What is the minimum number of matching ridge characteristics required to establish a positive fingerprint identification in the Philippines?

- [ ] 8
- [x] 10-12
- [ ] 15
- [ ] There is no fixed minimum number.

> **Explanation:** While there is no universal standard, the generally accepted practice in the Philippines and many other jurisdictions is that 10-12 matching minutiae are sufficient to establish a positive identification.

### 8. Which of the following is a type of minutiae (ridge characteristic)?

- [ ] Delta
- [ ] Core
- [x] Bifurcation
- [ ] Island

> **Explanation:** A bifurcation is a ridge that splits into two. Deltas and cores are focal points in a fingerprint pattern, not minutiae. An island is a short ridge, which is a type of minutiae.

### 9. What does AFIS stand for?

- [ ] Automated Fingerprint Identification Standard
- [x] Automated Fingerprint Identification System
- [ ] Advanced Fingerprint Information System
- [ ] Automated Forensic Identification System

> **Explanation:** AFIS stands for Automated Fingerprint Identification System, which is a computerized system for storing, searching, and retrieving fingerprint records.

### 10. Which chemical is commonly used to develop latent fingerprints on porous surfaces like paper?

- [ ] Cyanoacrylate
- [x] Ninhydrin
- [ ] Iodine fuming
- [ ] Amido black

> **Explanation:** Ninhydrin reacts with the amino acids in sweat to produce a purple-colored print called "Ruhemann's purple". It is very effective on porous surfaces. Cyanoacrylate (super glue) is used on non-porous surfaces.

### 11. What is the Bertillon System of identification?

- [ ] A system of fingerprint classification.
- [x] An early system of criminal identification based on body measurements.
- [ ] A method for analyzing DNA.
- [ ] A technique for developing latent prints.

> **Explanation:** The Bertillon System, or anthropometry, was developed by Alphonse Bertillon in the late 19th century. It involved taking a series of specific body measurements to create a unique profile for an individual. It was largely replaced by fingerprinting.

### 12. What is the principle that states that a fingerprint remains unchanged during an individual's lifetime?

- [ ] Principle of Individuality
- [x] Principle of Permanency
- [ ] Principle of Infallibility
- [ ] Principle of Uniqueness

> **Explanation:** The Principle of Permanency (or Persistence) states that the basic characteristics of fingerprints do not change from the time of their formation in the womb until after death.

### 13. Which of the following is considered the most reliable method of personal identification?

- [ ] Anthropometry
- [ ] Odontology
- [x] DNA Profiling
- [ ] Fingerprinting

> **Explanation:** DNA profiling is currently considered the most accurate and reliable method of personal identification because the probability of two individuals having the same DNA profile is extremely low.

### 14. What is the role of a forensic odontologist?

- [ ] To analyze skeletal remains.
- [x] To identify individuals through their dental records.
- [ ] To examine footprints at a crime scene.
- [ ] To analyze blood spatter patterns.

> **Explanation:** Forensic odontology is the application of dental science to legal investigations, primarily involving the identification of the deceased through dental records, especially in mass disasters.

### 15. In dactyloscopy, what is an "accidental whorl"?

- [ ] A fingerprint pattern with three deltas.
- [x] A combination of two or more different pattern types, excluding the plain arch.
- [ ] A whorl pattern that is scarred or mutilated.
- [ ] A loop with a whorl inside of it.

> **Explanation:** An accidental whorl is a pattern that consists of a combination of two different types of patterns, such as a loop and a whorl, or a loop and a tented arch, or it can be a pattern that conforms to none of the definitions.

### 16. The Vucetich system of fingerprint classification is primarily used in:

- [ ] The United States and the United Kingdom
- [x] Spanish-speaking countries and South America
- [ ] China and Japan
- [ ] Most of Europe

> **Explanation:** Juan Vucetich, an Argentine police official, developed a fingerprint classification system that became the basis for modern systems used in most Spanish-speaking countries.

### 17. A latent fingerprint is a print that is:

- [ ] Visible to the naked eye.
- [x] Invisible or hidden.
- [ ] Made in a soft material like wax or soap.
- [ ] A bloody fingerprint.

> **Explanation:** A latent fingerprint is an impression of the friction ridges of the human finger on a surface. It is an invisible print that must be developed through chemical or physical means.

### 18. What is the process of using superglue fumes to develop latent fingerprints called?

- [x] Cyanoacrylate fuming
- [ ] Iodine fuming
- [ ] Ninhydrin processing
- [ ] Silver nitrate method

> **Explanation:** Cyanoacrylate ester, the chemical in superglue, reacts with the moisture in a latent print to form a white, plastic-like residue, making the print visible. This process is known as cyanoacrylate fuming.

### 19. What part of a tooth is most resistant to decomposition and is therefore most useful in post-mortem identification?

- [ ] Dentin
- [ ] Pulp
- [x] Enamel
- [ ] Cementum

> **Explanation:** Tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the human body and is highly resistant to heat, decomposition, and other destructive forces, making it invaluable for dental identification.

### 20. In a mass disaster scenario, which of the following is a primary identifier for victim identification according to DVI (Disaster Victim Identification) protocols?

- [x] Fingerprints, Dental Records, DNA
- [ ] Personal effects, clothing, tattoos
- [ ] Driver's license, ID cards
- [ ] Eyewitness accounts

> **Explanation:** DVI protocols rely on primary scientific methods for positive identification. These are fingerprints, dental records (forensic odontology), and DNA analysis. Secondary identifiers like personal effects and documents can support the identification but are not considered conclusive on their own.

### 21. What is a "ridge ending"?

- [ ] A ridge that splits into two ridges.
- [x] A single friction ridge that terminates within the friction ridge structure.
- [ ] A single friction ridge that bifurcates and rejoins.
- [ ] Two ridges that run side-by-side and then separate.

> **Explanation:** A ridge ending is a basic minutia where a single ridge comes to an end. A ridge that splits is a bifurcation.

### 22. The core of a fingerprint pattern is the:

- [ ] Outermost ridge of the pattern.
- [x] Approximate center of the pattern.
- [ ] Point where the ridges diverge.
- [ ] The delta.

> **Explanation:** The core is a focal point located at the approximate center of the fingerprint pattern.

### 23. The number of ridges intervening between the delta and the core is known as:

- [ ] The core count
- [ ] The delta count
- [x] The ridge count
- [ ] The pattern count

> **Explanation:** The ridge count is determined by drawing an imaginary line between the delta and the core and counting the number of ridges that cross or touch this line. It is used in the classification of loops.

### 24. A "tented arch" is distinguished from a "plain arch" by:

- [ ] The presence of a delta.
- [x] The ridges in the center forming a more definite, sharp angle.
- [ ] The ridges flowing in a circular pattern.
- [ ] The absence of a core.

> **Explanation:** A tented arch has a significant upthrust or a sharp angle in the center, which differentiates it from the smoother, wavelike pattern of a plain arch. It does not have a delta.

### 25. Which of the following is NOT a fundamental layer of the skin?

- [ ] Epidermis
- [ ] Dermis
- [x] Subcutaneous
- [ ] Hypodermis

> **Explanation:** The subcutaneous layer, while located beneath the skin, is technically not considered a layer of the skin itself. The primary layers are the Epidermis and Dermis. The Hypodermis is often considered the third, deepest layer.

### 26. In the Philippines, what is the primary government agency that manages the national fingerprint database?

- [x] Philippine National Police (PNP)
- [ ] National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)
- [ ] Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)
- [ ] Department of Justice (DOJ)

> **Explanation:** The Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory maintains and operates the country's Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for criminal identification purposes.

### 27. What is cheiloscopy?

- [ ] The study of ear prints for identification.
- [ ] The study of skeletal remains.
- [x] The study of lip prints for identification.
- [ ] The study of handwriting.

> **Explanation:** Cheiloscopy is the forensic investigation technique that deals with the identification of humans based on lip traces. The wrinkles and grooves on the lips are considered unique to each person.

### 28. What is the primary reason fingerprint identification replaced the Bertillon system?

- [x] Fingerprints are unique and do not change, while body measurements can change over time.
- [ ] The Bertillon system was too slow.
- [ ] Fingerprinting is less invasive.
- [ ] The equipment for anthropometry was too expensive.

> **Explanation:** The primary failing of the Bertillon system was that body measurements are not entirely unique and can change as a person ages or gains/loses weight. The famous Will and William West case in 1903 demonstrated this flaw, as two different inmates had nearly identical Bertillon measurements but different fingerprints.

### 29. A double loop whorl is composed of:

- [ ] Two deltas and one core.
- [x] Two separate and distinct loop formations with two separate and distinct shoulders for each core, and two deltas.
- [ ] A loop and a plain whorl.
- [ ] A pattern with a spiral core.

> **Explanation:** The double loop whorl is made up of two distinct loops that are intertwined. Each loop has its own core, and the pattern has two deltas.

### 30. Which of the following chemical methods for developing latent prints should be used first, as it is non-destructive?

- [x] Iodine fuming
- [ ] Ninhydrin
- [ ] Silver Nitrate
- [ ] Cyanoacrylate fuming

> **Explanation:** Iodine fuming is a temporary, non-destructive method that should be used first in a sequence of chemical treatments. The fumes adhere to the oils in a print, making it visible. The print will fade, so it must be photographed. This allows for subsequent treatments like Ninhydrin.
