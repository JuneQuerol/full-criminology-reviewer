## 2. IMPRUDENCE AND NEGLIGENCE (Art. 365)

Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code is the primary law that governs quasi-offenses in the Philippines.

### A. DEFINITION OF QUASI-OFFENSE
A quasi-offense is a distinct crime defined under Art. 365. It is a felony committed by means of **culpa** (fault), where a person, without criminal intent (dolo), causes damage to another through an act or omission characterized by imprudence or negligence.

- **Felony committed by means of culpa:** The act itself is a crime, but it is not intentional. The crime is the negligence itself.
- **No criminal intent (dolo):** The offender did not intend to cause the harm. The injury or damage is an unintended consequence of a negligent act.
- **Damage caused through fault:** The liability arises from the failure to exercise the necessary care and diligence required by the situation.

### B. RECKLESS IMPRUDENCE
Reckless imprudence consists of voluntarily, but without malice, doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.

- **Voluntary act without malice:** The act is willed and performed freely, but the resulting harm is not intended.
- **Without due care and circumspection:** The person fails to take the standard precautions that a prudent person would take to avoid harm to others. The danger is obvious and immediate, but the offender ignores it.
- **Examples:**
    - **Reckless Driving:** A driver overspeeds on a crowded street during rush hour and hits a pedestrian.
    - **Medical Malpractice:** A surgeon leaves a surgical instrument inside a patient's body after an operation.

### C. SIMPLE IMPRUDENCE
Simple imprudence consists in the lack of precaution displayed in those cases in which the damage impending to be caused is not immediate nor the danger clearly manifest.

- **Definition:** It involves a deficiency of precaution, but the danger is not as clear or imminent as in reckless imprudence.
- **Lack of precaution:** The offender fails to exercise care, but the risk of harm is not as obvious.
- **Damage not immediately apparent:** The potential for harm is not readily foreseeable.

### D. NEGLIGENCE
Negligence is the failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in a similar situation. It is the omission of the diligence which is required by the nature of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances of the persons, of the time, and of the place.

- **Definition:** It is a failure to perform a duty, resulting in harm.
- **Omission of care:** It is characterized by the failure to act when there is a duty to do so.

## 3. ELEMENTS OF QUASI-OFFENSE

For a quasi-offense to exist, the following elements must be present:
1.  That the offender does or fails to do an act.
2.  That the doing or the failure to do that act is voluntary.
3.  That it be without malice (criminal intent).
4.  That the material damage or injury results from the said act or omission.
5.  That there is an inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the offender (imprudence or negligence).

---

## 4. CLASSIFICATION OF QUASI-OFFENSES

Quasi-offenses are penalized based on the gravity of the felony that would have resulted had the act been committed with intent.

### A. RECKLESS IMPRUDENCE RESULTING IN:
- **Homicide:** If the reckless act results in death.
- **Serious Physical Injuries:** If the victim is incapacitated for more than 30 days or loses a body part.
- **Less Serious Physical Injuries:** If the victim is incapacitated for 10 to 30 days.
- **Slight Physical Injuries:** If the victim is incapacitated for 1 to 9 days.
- **Damage to Property:** If the reckless act causes damage to another's property.

### B. SIMPLE IMPRUDENCE OR NEGLIGENCE RESULTING IN:
- The same classification of offenses (Homicide, Physical Injuries, Damage to Property) applies, but the penalties are lower due to the lesser degree of negligence.

## 6. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

- **Failure to Lend Aid:** If the offender, after committing a quasi-offense, fails to render aid to the victim, the penalty is one degree higher.
- **Failure to Take Victim to Hospital:** This is considered in imposing the penalty.
- **Compound Negligence:** If a single act of negligence produces multiple grave or less grave felonies, the offender shall be punished for the most serious crime, the penalty to be imposed in its maximum period. This is also known as a "complex crime."

## 8. RELATED LAWS

- **Anti-Distracted Driving Act (RA 10913):** Prohibits drivers from using mobile communication devices and other electronic entertainment gadgets while their vehicles are in motion or temporarily stopped at a traffic light or intersection. A violation of this act can be used as evidence of negligence in a quasi-offense case.
- **Land Transportation and Traffic Code (RA 4136):** Provides rules of the road, speed limits, and vehicle regulations. Violations (e.g., speeding, driving without a license) are often used to establish negligence in vehicular accident cases.

---

## 9. IMPORTANT CASE EXAMPLES

- **Medical Malpractice:** In *Rosit v. DAVAO DOCTORS HOSPITAL*, the Supreme Court found a surgeon liable for reckless imprudence resulting in physical injuries for leaving a foreign object (gauze) in the patient's body. The doctrine of *res ipsa loquitur* ("the thing speaks for itself") was applied, as the incident would not have happened in the ordinary course of things if due care was exercised.
- **Vehicular Accidents:** In cases where a driver violates traffic rules (e.g., speeding, illegal overtaking, driving under the influence) and causes a collision, they are generally held liable for reckless imprudence. The violation of a traffic regulation is often considered negligence per se.
- **Industrial Accidents:** An employer who fails to provide necessary safety equipment (like harnesses for construction workers at height) and a worker falls to his death can be held liable for reckless imprudence resulting in homicide.

### **ANSWER KEY**

1.  **C) Fault or Negligence**
    *   **Explanation:** Quasi-offenses are defined by the presence of culpa (fault/negligence), not dolo (intent/malice).
2.  **C) Reckless Imprudence**
    *   **Explanation:** The key phrase is "inexcusable lack of precaution," which is the hallmark of reckless imprudence.
3.  **B) There is malice or criminal intent**
    *   **Explanation:** The absence of malice or criminal intent is a fundamental element of a quasi-offense.
4.  **D) Reckless Imprudence resulting in damage to property**
    *   **Explanation:** Texting while driving is a clear and obvious danger (inexcusable lack of precaution). RA 10913 is violated, but the resulting crime for the collision itself is the quasi-offense.
5.  **B) Simple Imprudence resulting in physical injuries**
    *   **Explanation:** While negligent, the danger was not as plain, immediate, or obvious as in reckless cases. It's a failure to take a basic precaution where the danger wasn't clearly manifest.
6.  **D) Reckless Imprudence**
    *   **Explanation:** Reckless imprudence (or gross negligence) is the highest degree of criminal negligence and carries the stiffest penalties among quasi-offenses.
7.  **C) Res ipsa loquitur**
    *   **Explanation:** This doctrine applies when the event is of a kind that does not ordinarily occur in the absence of someone's negligence.
8.  **C) Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the specific nomenclature for the quasi-offense. It is distinct from the intentional felony of Homicide.
9.  **C) The penalty for the quasi-offense shall be one degree higher.**
    *   **Explanation:** Article 365 explicitly provides for this aggravating circumstance for quasi-offenses.
10. **B) Fault**
    *   **Explanation:** Dolo is the Spanish term for deceit/intent, while Culpa is the term for fault/negligence.
11. **C) Imminence and visibility of the danger**
    *   **Explanation:** In reckless imprudence, the danger is obvious and immediate. In simple imprudence, it is not.
12. **C) A compound crime (complex crime proper) under Art. 48**
    *   **Explanation:** When a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, it is a complex crime. Art. 365 applies this concept to quasi-offenses.
13. **C) The crime that would have resulted if the act was intentional**
    *   **Explanation:** The penalty for negligence is based on the penalty for the resulting crime (e.g., homicide, physical injuries) had it been committed with intent, but reduced.
14. **C) Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide**
    *   **Explanation:** Administering medicine is part of a nurse's professional duty. Misreading a prescription and causing death is a classic example of inexcusable lack of precaution (reckless imprudence) due to the high standard of care required.
15. **C) Skill; care**
    *   **Explanation:** Imprudence is often linked to a lack of skill or foresight in a positive act. Negligence is a failure to exercise the required care, often through omission.
16. **B) A security guard failing to lock the main gate**
    *   **Explanation:** This is an omission or failure to perform a duty, which is a negative act. The others are positive acts of commission.
17. **A) Arresto mayor in its minimum and medium periods**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the penalty prescribed in the table under Article 365.
18. **B) Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide**
    *   **Explanation:** The foreman consciously disregarded a clear and manifest danger identified in a survey, showing an inexcusable lack of precaution.
19. **B) RA 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code)**
    *   **Explanation:** Violation of a traffic law (like speeding) is considered negligence per se, making it powerful evidence in a quasi-offense case involving a vehicular accident.
20. **A) 25 pesos**
    *   **Explanation:** Article 365 specifies that the fine "shall in no case be less than 25 pesos," even if the damage value is lower.
