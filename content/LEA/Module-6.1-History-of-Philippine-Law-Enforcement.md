## I. Law Enforcement in Pre-Colonial Philippines

Before the arrival of the Spanish in 1521, the Philippines was an archipelago of independent and semi-independent states and barangays. Each community had its own set of rules and customs.

### A. The Barangay System
- **Datu/Rajah:** The head of the barangay acted as the chief executive, legislator, and judge.
- **Umalohokan:** The barangay crier, responsible for disseminating new laws or decrees to the public.
- **Customary Laws:** Justice was based on unwritten laws and traditions passed down through generations. Examples include the Code of Kalantiaw (now widely considered a historical hoax) and the Maragtas Code.
- **Trial by Ordeal:** A common method to determine guilt or innocence, involving subjecting the accused to a dangerous or painful test. The outcome was believed to be determined by divine intervention.

### B. Enforcement and Punishment
- The datu's warriors or designated members of the community enforced the laws.
- Punishments ranged from fines (often paid in gold or goods) and servitude to physical penalties and death, depending on the severity of the crime.

**Board Exam Tip:** Questions about pre-colonial justice often focus on the roles of the datu and the concept of customary law. Be aware of the distinction between accepted historical fact and discredited sources like the Code of Kalantiaw.

## IV. The Japanese Occupation & Post-War Era (1942-1946)

During World War II, the Japanese military took control of all police functions.

### A. Kempeitai
- The military police arm of the Imperial Japanese Army.
- They were the supreme military and political authority, notorious for their brutality and human rights abuses.
- Filipino police forces, including the PC, were disbanded and their members were either incorporated into Japanese-controlled constabulary units or joined the guerilla resistance.

### B. Post-War Reorganization
- After the war, the PC was reconstituted.
- The issue of multiple, uncoordinated police forces (local police, PC) persisted, leading to calls for reform and integration.
- This period saw a rise in crime and political instability, highlighting the need for a more unified and professional police system.

## Introduction

This module provides a detailed history of the organized systems of law enforcement in the Philippines. Understanding the historical foundations of the Philippine National Police (PNP) is crucial for appreciating its current structure, challenges, and the legal framework that governs it. We will trace the lineage of policing from pre-colonial societies through the Spanish, American, and Japanese occupations, culminating in the establishment of the modern police force.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Identify the forms of law enforcement during the pre-colonial period.
- Analyze the impact of Spanish colonization on the Philippine justice system.
- Describe the establishment and development of the police force during the American regime.
- Understand the role of the police during the Japanese occupation and World War II.
- Trace the post-war evolution leading to the creation of the PNP.


## II. The Spanish Colonial Period (1521-1898)

The Spanish introduced a more centralized and formal system of law enforcement based on Roman civil law.

### A. Carabineros de Seguridad Publica (1712)
- Considered the first organized police force in the Philippines.
- Its purpose was to carry out the regulations of the state and was armed with carbines.
- Initially formed to patrol the provinces, it was later absorbed by the Guardia Civil.

### B. The Guardia Civil (1868)
- Created by a Royal Decree of the Spanish Crown, patterned after the renowned Spanish Guardia Civil.
- **Structure:** It was a national police force with both provincial and municipal-level units, composed of Filipino and Spanish personnel but commanded by Spanish officers.
- **Duties:**
    - Maintaining peace and order.
    - Guarding the provinces and towns.
    - Suppressing brigandage and rebellion.
- **Legacy:** The Guardia Civil was known for its discipline and military-style organization but also for its abuses of power, which fueled revolutionary sentiment. Jose Rizal depicted these abuses in his novels, *Noli Me Tángere* and *El Filibusterismo*.

### C. Guardrilleros (Rural Police)
- A local police force established in each town, composed of able-bodied male residents.
- They were required to perform patrol duties for a set number of days each month.
- Their primary function was to act as *cuadrilleros* or watchmen, reporting to the *gobernadorcillo* (town mayor).

## III. The American Regime (1898-1946)

The Americans established police forces that mirrored the structure of those in the United States, emphasizing civilian control and local governance.

### A. The Philippine Constabulary (PC) (1901)
- **RA 175:** Enacted on July 18, 1901, creating the Philippine Constabulary.
- **Captain Henry T. Allen:** The first Chief of the Philippine Constabulary, later known as the "Father of the Constabulary."
- **Nature:** It was a gendarmerie-type national police force, initially commanded by American officers but gradually Filipinized.
- **Functions:**
    - Suppressing insurrection and maintaining peace and order.
    - Performing traditional police duties.
    - It became the backbone of the Philippine military establishment.
- **Legacy:** The PC played a central role in Philippine law enforcement for nearly 90 years, eventually becoming one of the four major service commands of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

### B. Manila Police Department (MPD) (1901)
- Organized on July 31, 1901, becoming the first metropolitan police force in the Philippines.
- **Captain George Curry:** The first Chief of Police.
- It was composed mainly of American officers and Filipino patrolmen.
- The MPD was a model for other city and municipal police forces created throughout the country.

### C. Revised Administrative Code of 1917
- This code provided for the creation of police forces in all municipalities, which were under the control of the municipal president (mayor).
- It established a system where local police were independent of the PC, leading to issues of jurisdiction and coordination.

**Board Exam Tip:** Memorize the key dates, names, and Republic Acts associated with the American period, especially the creation of the Philippine Constabulary and the Manila Police Department. Captain Henry T. Allen is a frequently asked name.


## V. The Modern Era: Towards a Single National Police

The decades following independence were marked by efforts to integrate the various police forces into a single, unified organization.

### A. Police Act of 1966 (RA 4864)
- Also known as the "Police Professionalization Act of 1966."
- Created the **Police Commission (POLCOM)**, which later became the **National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM)**.
- **Goals:**
    - To professionalize local police forces.
    - To establish a uniform standard for recruitment, training, and discipline.
    - To provide for a system of inspection and audit.
- While it did not fully integrate the police, it was a critical step towards nationalizing and standardizing them.

### B. The Integrated National Police (INP) (1975)
- **Presidential Decree 765:** Issued on August 8, 1975, it established the Integrated National Police (INP).
- **Structure:** The INP integrated all city and municipal police, fire, and jail services under the command of the Philippine Constabulary.
    - The Chief of the PC was concurrently the Director-General of the INP.
- This marked the first time the Philippines had a single, integrated police force. However, it was still under the supervision of the military (AFP), blurring the line between civilian and military functions.

### C. The Philippine National Police (PNP) (1991)
- **Republic Act 6975 (DILG Act of 1990):** This landmark legislation, signed on December 13, 1990, created the **Philippine National Police (PNP)**.
- **Key Provisions:**
    - The PNP was established as a national, civilian police force under the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).
    - It absorbed the members of the INP and the PC.
    - It officially separated the police from the military, reinforcing the principle that the police are civilian in character.
- **RA 8551 (PNP Reform and Reorganization Act of 1998):** Further amended RA 6975 to strengthen the PNP, improve its efficiency, and promote police discipline.
- **RA 9708:** Extended the period for PNP members to obtain their required educational qualifications.
