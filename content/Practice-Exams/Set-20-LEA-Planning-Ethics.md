title: 'Practice Exam: Law Enforcement Administration - Police Planning & Ethics (Set 20)'
description: 'A 30-question practice exam covering police planning, decision-making, ethics, human rights, and comparative police systems.'
---

### 1. A police station commander is developing a plan to manage traffic and crowd control for an upcoming city-wide festival next month. This type of plan is best described as:

- [ ] Strategic Plan
- [x] Operational Plan
- [ ] Tactical Plan
- [ ] Contingency Plan

> Explanation: An Operational Plan is a short-term, specific plan for a known event. It details how to carry out activities to achieve a particular objective, such as managing a festival. Strategic plans are long-term, tactical plans are for immediate on-the-ground situations, and contingency plans are for unforeseen events.

### 2. Which decision-making model prioritizes finding a "good enough" solution over the "perfect" one, especially under time pressure?

- [ ] Rational Model
- [ ] Incremental Model
- [x] Bounded Rationality Model
- [ ] Heuristic Model

> Explanation: The Bounded Rationality Model, developed by Herbert Simon, acknowledges that decision-makers are limited by cognitive constraints, time, and available information. Therefore, they often "satisfice" by choosing the first satisfactory alternative rather than searching for the optimal one.

### 3. A police officer who refuses a bribe from a traffic violator, citing a deep-seated belief in upholding the law, is demonstrating which core ethical principle?

- [ ] Service
- [x] Integrity
- [ ] Justice
- [ ] Professionalism

> Explanation: Integrity is the firm adherence to a code of moral values. It involves being honest, incorruptible, and upright, which is precisely what the officer demonstrates by refusing the bribe.

### 4. The PNP Code of Professional Conduct and Ethical Standards (RA 6713) emphasizes "commitment to democracy." What does this primarily entail for a police officer?

- [ ] Blindly obeying all orders from superiors.
- [x] Upholding the Constitution and the rights of citizens above all else.
- [ ] Prioritizing the needs of the ruling political party.
- [ ] Focusing solely on crime suppression without regard for public opinion.

> Explanation: Commitment to democracy means that law enforcement power emanates from the people. Officers are duty-bound to uphold the Constitution, respect due process, and protect the rights of all citizens, ensuring they serve the public and not a particular regime or individual.

### 5. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the right to life, liberty, and security of person is considered:

- [ ] A privilege granted by the state.
- [x] An inalienable right.
- [ ] A conditional right.
- [ ] A right exclusive to citizens of a country.

> Explanation: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) posits that fundamental rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and security, are inalienable. This means they cannot be taken away, sold, or given away, as they are inherent to every human being.

### 6. The PNP Use of Force Continuum dictates that an officer's response should be one level higher than the subject's resistance. What is the appropriate response to a suspect who is verbally non-compliant but not physically aggressive?

- [ ] Lethal force
- [ ] Hard-hand control techniques
- [x] Verbal commands and persuasion
- [ ] Soft-hand control techniques

> Explanation: The continuum starts with officer presence and verbal commands. If a subject is merely non-compliant verbally, the initial and most appropriate response is to use strong verbal commands and persuasion before escalating to any physical force.

### 7. The French police system, with its centralized structure under a minister of the interior, is a classic example of which police system model?

- [x] Continental System
- [ ] Anglo-Saxon System
- [ ] Socialist System
- [ ] Post-Colonial System

> Explanation: The Continental (or Civil Law) System is characterized by a centralized, hierarchical police structure under the national government. The French Gendarmerie Nationale and Police Nationale are prime examples of this model.

### 8. What is the primary function of the INTERPOL Red Notice?

- [ ] To serve as an international arrest warrant.
- [ ] To provide intelligence on potential terror threats.
- [x] To seek the location and provisional arrest of a person pending extradition.
- [ ] To list missing persons believed to have crossed borders.

> Explanation: A Red Notice is an international alert to seek the location and provisional arrest of a wanted individual, based on a valid national arrest warrant. It is not an arrest warrant itself but a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and detain the person.

### 9. Which of the following best embodies the standard of police professionalism?

- [ ] Focusing on arrest quotas over the quality of investigations.
- [x] Continuous training, adherence to ethical standards, and accountability for actions.
- [ ] Maintaining a physically intimidating presence to deter crime.
- [ ] Using technical jargon to assert authority when dealing with civilians.

> Explanation: Professionalism in policing is marked by a commitment to high standards. This includes ongoing education, a strong ethical framework, mastery of policing skills, and a willingness to be held accountable for one's performance and conduct.

### 10. A police officer is found to have neglected his duty, leading to the escape of a detainee. What type of administrative offense is this?

- [x] Nonfeasance
- [ ] Misfeasance
- [ ] Malfeasance
- [ ] Misconduct

> Explanation: Nonfeasance is the failure to perform a required act or duty. Since the officer neglected to perform his duties, which resulted in the escape, it is a clear case of nonfeasance. Misfeasance is improper performance of a lawful act, while malfeasance is the performance of an illegal act.

### 11. A police district is creating a long-range plan to reduce organized crime over the next five years by building community trust and enhancing intelligence capabilities. This is an example of:

- [ ] Tactical Planning
- [x] Strategic Planning
- [ ] Operational Planning
- [ ] Policy Planning

> Explanation: Strategic Planning is long-term, broad in scope, and focused on achieving the overall mission and vision of the organization. A five-year plan to address a systemic issue like organized crime fits this description perfectly.

### 12. The "OODA Loop" is a decision-making tool in law enforcement. What do the letters stand for?

- [ ] Observe, Orient, Decide, Act
- [x] Observe, Orient, Decide, Act
- [ ] Order, Observe, Decide, Attack
- [ ] Organize, Orient, Delegate, Act

> Explanation: The OODA Loop, developed by military strategist John Boyd, is a four-stage cycle for decision-making in dynamic environments. It stands for Observe (gather information), Orient (analyze and synthesize), Decide (select a course of action), and Act (execute the decision).

### 13. Which ethical standard under the PNP Code requires officers to perform their duties without favoritism or discrimination?

- [ ] Devotion to Duty
- [ ] Loyalty
- [x] Justice and Impartiality
- [ ] Non-partisanship

> Explanation: Justice and Impartiality (often simply referred to as 'Impartiality' in the code) requires that all citizens be treated equally, without regard to their social status, gender, religion, or other affiliations. This principle forbids favoritism and ensures fair application of the law.

### 14. What is the "Miranda Doctrine" primarily concerned with?

- [x] The rights of a person under custodial investigation.
- [ ] The rules of evidence in court.
- [ ] The procedures for conducting a search and seizure.
- [ ] The classification of criminal offenses.

> Explanation: The Miranda Doctrine, originating from the U.S. case *Miranda v. Arizona* and enshrined in Philippine law, guarantees the right of a suspect to remain silent, the right to a competent and independent counsel, and the right to be informed of these rights during a custodial investigation.

### 15. The principle of "proportionality" in the use of force means:

- [ ] The force used should be slightly greater than the threat.
- [ ] The force used should match the force offered by the subject.
- [x] The amount of force used should be the minimum necessary to achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective.
- [ ] Lethal force is proportional to any form of physical resistance.

> Explanation: Proportionality dictates that the level and nature of the force used must be commensurate with the gravity of the offense and the threat posed. The primary goal is to use only the minimum force necessary to control the situation and protect life.

### 16. The Anglo-Saxon police system, which emphasizes local control and community policing, is best exemplified by the police in:

- [ ] Germany
- [x] United Kingdom
- [ ] Japan
- [ ] Italy

> Explanation: The Anglo-Saxon system, originating in England, is characterized by decentralized police forces with strong ties to the local community they serve. The concept of "policing by consent" is central to this model, which is prominent in the UK, USA, and other Commonwealth countries.

### 17. An officer uses the INTERPOL database to check if a foreign national detained for a local crime is wanted in their home country. This is an example of:

- [ ] Extradition
- [x] International police cooperation
- [ ] Diplomatic immunity
- [ ] Transnational investigation

> Explanation: This action is a clear example of international police cooperation, where law enforcement agencies from different countries share information and resources through established channels like INTERPOL to combat crime more effectively.

### 18. A "plan" in the context of police management can be best defined as:

- [x] An organized method of doing or acting.
- [ ] A spontaneous reaction to a crisis.
- [ ] A set of unwritten rules.
- [ ] A leader's personal vision.

> Explanation: A plan is a deliberate and organized process of setting objectives and outlining the steps, resources, and timeline required to achieve them. It is a systematic method, not a spontaneous reaction or personal whim.

### 19. If a police officer shoots a fleeing suspect who poses no immediate threat of death or serious injury to the officer or others, it violates which key principle?

- [ ] The principle of distinction
- [x] The principle of necessity
- [ ] The principle of accountability
- [ ] The principle of discretion

> Explanation: The principle of necessity dictates that force, especially lethal force, should only be used when it is strictly unavoidable to protect life. If the suspect poses no immediate threat, the use of lethal force is not necessary and is therefore unlawful.

### 20. The internal disciplinary body for the Philippine National Police is the:

- [ ] National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM)
- [x] Internal Affairs Service (IAS)
- [ ] People's Law Enforcement Board (PLEB)
- [ ] Civil Service Commission (CSC)

> Explanation: The Internal Affairs Service (IAS) is the primary internal unit mandated by law (RA 8551) to investigate complaints and gather evidence in support of citizen's complaints against PNP members. It can initiate its own investigations even without a formal complaint.

### 21. You are a police patrol supervisor. A major traffic collision has just occurred, blocking a critical intersection during rush hour. You direct your officers on the scene to immediately reroute traffic and assist the injured. This is an example of:

- [ ] Strategic Decision Making
- [x] Tactical Decision Making
- [ ] Policy Implementation
- [ ] Procedural Planning

> Explanation: Tactical decisions are made on-the-ground to handle immediate situations and crises. The supervisor's actions are a direct, short-term response to a specific event, aimed at controlling the scene and mitigating immediate problems.

### 22. Which is NOT a core value explicitly stated in the PNP's ethical doctrine?

- [ ] Love of God
- [ ] Respect for Authority
- [ ] Selfless Love of Country
- [x] Financial Prudence

> Explanation: The PNP's core values include Maka-Diyos (Pro-God), Makabayan (Pro-Country), Makatao (Pro-People), and Makakalikasan (Pro-Environment). While financial prudence is a good trait, it is not listed as one of the foundational core values in the same way the others are.

### 23. An officer investigating a case discovers evidence that exonerates the primary suspect but implicates a prominent local official. He chooses to suppress this evidence. This act is a form of:

- [ ] Malfeasance
- [x] Obstruction of Justice
- [ ] Nonfeasance
- [ ] Command Responsibility

> Explanation: By deliberately hiding evidence to protect an individual and prevent the true course of an investigation, the officer is committing Obstruction of Justice. This is a form of malfeasance (wrongful conduct by a public official).

### 24. What fundamental human right is most directly at risk during a prolonged and incommunicado detention?

- [ ] The right to property
- [ ] The right to free speech
- [x] The right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
- [ ] The right to assembly

> Explanation: Incommunicado detention isolates a detainee, removing them from the protection of the law, legal counsel, and family. This isolation creates a high-risk environment for torture and other forms of ill-treatment, as accountability is diminished.

### 25. The Japanese police system, with its emphasis on community partnership through "Koban" (police boxes), shares features of which two models?

- [ ] Socialist and Continental
- [x] Anglo-Saxon and its own unique model
- [ ] Continental and Anglo-Saxon
- [ ] Colonial and Tribal

> Explanation: The Japanese system is unique but incorporates strong elements of the Anglo-Saxon model, particularly its focus on local, community-based policing through the Koban system. However, it maintains a centralized structure, a feature more aligned with the Continental model, making it a hybrid.

### 26. When is it permissible for a police officer to use their service firearm?

- [ ] To stop any fleeing felon.
- [ ] As a warning shot to disperse an unruly crowd.
- [x] Only in self-defense or defense of others from an imminent threat of death or serious injury.
- [ ] To destroy property to prevent a crime.

> Explanation: The PNP operational procedures are strict. A firearm is a tool of last resort. Its use is justified only when there is a clear and imminent threat to someone's life or they are at risk of serious bodily harm. Warning shots are explicitly prohibited.

### 27. The concept of "Command Responsibility" in the PNP context means:

- [ ] A commander is only responsible for their own personal actions.
- [x] A superior officer is responsible for the misconduct of their subordinates if they knew or should have known about it and failed to take corrective action.
- [ ] Subordinates can blame their commander for any illegal orders they follow.
- [ ] Only the highest-ranking officer in an operation can be held liable.

> Explanation: Command Responsibility holds that a superior officer can be held administratively and even criminally liable for the unlawful acts of their subordinates if they failed to exercise proper supervision and control to prevent or punish the misconduct.

### 28. Which of the following is an example of a "proactive" police plan?

- [ ] A plan to investigate a robbery that has already occurred.
- [x] A plan to establish a neighborhood watch program in a high-crime area.
- [ ] A plan to respond to emergency calls for service.
- [ ] A plan for post-disaster cleanup operations.

> Explanation: Proactive plans are those that aim to prevent crime or problems before they happen. Establishing a neighborhood watch is a preventive measure. The other options are reactive, as they respond to events that have already taken place.

### 29. The PNP's policy of "delicadeza" requires officers to:

- [ ] Strictly follow every written rule without exception.
- [ ] Prioritize loyalty to their fellow officers above all.
- [x] Behave in a manner that does not bring discredit to the police service, even in their private life.
- [ ] Seek promotions and awards actively.

> Explanation: Delicadeza refers to a sense of propriety and honor. It means that officers should be sensitive to public perception and avoid any action, on or off duty, that could tarnish the reputation of the PNP or create a conflict of interest.

### 30. An INTERPOL Blue Notice is issued for what purpose?

- [ ] To warn about a person who is a public safety threat.
- [x] To collect additional information about a person's identity, location, or activities in relation to a crime.
- [ ] To locate a missing person.
- [ ] To seek the arrest of an individual wanted for a serious crime.

> Explanation: A Blue Notice, also known as an "Enquiry Notice," is a tool used by member countries to request more information from other members about a person of interest in a criminal investigation. It is for intelligence gathering, not for arrest (Red Notice) or to warn (Green Notice).
