# Module 10.10: Executive Clemency & GCTA (RA 10592)

## Introduction

Beyond the judicial processes of trial and sentencing, and the administrative process of parole, there are other legal mechanisms that can modify a prisoner's sentence. These fall into two main categories: **Executive Clemency**, which is an act of grace by the Chief Executive, and **Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA)**, which is a statutory privilege earned by the prisoner through good behavior. This module will explain the different forms of executive clemency and detail the provisions of RA 10592, the law that governs GCTA.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define Executive Clemency and identify its legal basis.
- Differentiate between the forms of clemency: Pardon (Absolute and Conditional), Amnesty, and Commutation of Sentence.
- Understand the purpose and mechanics of the Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) under RA 10592.
- Explain the role of the Board of Pardons and Parole in the clemency process.

## I. Executive Clemency

**Definition:** Executive Clemency refers to the power of the President of the Philippines to grant mercy and leniency to a convicted person. It is a discretionary power that cannot be limited or controlled by the legislature or the courts.

- **Legal Basis:** Article VII, Section 19 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution grants the President the "power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment."
- **Role of the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP):** While the power belongs to the President, the BPP is the administrative body tasked with reviewing petitions for clemency and making recommendations to the President.

### Forms of Executive Clemency

1.  **Pardon:**
    - **Definition:** An act of grace by the President that forgives the offender and relieves them of the legal consequences of their crime.
    - **It does not erase the conviction:** A pardon does not mean the person is innocent; it simply forgives the guilt. The conviction remains on their record.
    - **Two Types of Pardon:**
        - **Absolute Pardon:** A total extinction of the criminal liability. The person is restored to their full civil and political rights.
        - **Conditional Pardon:** The offender is released from prison, but they must comply with a set of conditions. If they violate any of the conditions, they can be re-arrested and returned to prison to serve their original sentence.

2.  **Amnesty:**
    - **Definition:** An act of the sovereign power granting a general pardon for a **past offense**, usually to a **class or group of persons** who have committed **political offenses**.
    - **Pardon vs. Amnesty:**
        - A pardon is granted to an **individual** for a **common crime**. An amnesty is granted to a **group** for **political crimes**.
        - A pardon is a private act of the President. An amnesty requires the concurrence of a majority of all the members of the Congress.
        - A pardon does not erase the conviction. An amnesty erases all legal trace of the crime.

3.  **Commutation of Sentence:**
    - **Definition:** The reduction of a sentence from a longer term to a shorter term. It does not forgive the guilt of the person but simply reduces the length of their punishment.
    - **Example:** A sentence of life imprisonment is commuted to a sentence of 30 years.
    - This is often done for inmates sentenced to life imprisonment to make them eligible for parole.

4.  **Reprieve:**
    - **Definition:** The temporary postponement or suspension of the execution of a sentence, usually a death sentence. It does not change the sentence but merely delays its implementation.

## II. Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) - RA 10592

While clemency is an act of executive grace, GCTA is a **statutory right** that a prisoner earns through good behavior. It is a sentence reduction privilege.

- **Legal Basis:** **Republic Act No. 10592**, enacted in 2013, amended the Revised Penal Code to increase the amount of GCTA that can be earned and to allow for its application to detention prisoners.

### A. What is GCTA?
- **Definition:** GCTA is a deduction from a prisoner's sentence for good conduct and for actively participating in rehabilitation programs.
- **Purpose:** To serve as a primary incentive for good behavior and to encourage inmates to engage in treatment programs.
- **Who is eligible?** All convicted prisoners in any jail or prison are eligible. The law also allows detention prisoners to earn GCTA.

### B. How GCTA is Calculated
RA 10592 provides a progressive schedule for GCTA credits. The longer a prisoner serves and maintains good behavior, the more "good time" they earn per month.

| Period of Incarceration | Good Conduct Time Allowance |
| :--- | :--- |
| First two years of imprisonment | **20 days** deduction for each month of actual service. |
| Third to the fifth year | **23 days** deduction for each month. |
| The following years up to the tenth year| **25 days** deduction for each month. |
| The eleventh and successive years | **30 days** deduction for each month. |

### C. Special Time Allowance for Loyalty (STAL)
- In addition to GCTA, a prisoner can earn a **Special Time Allowance for Loyalty (STAL)**.
- **How it is earned:** This is granted to a prisoner who, having been granted a trust-based status (like a "trustee" or a minimum-security inmate), chooses to remain in the prison during a calamity or catastrophe (like a fire, earthquake, or riot) instead of escaping.
- **Credit:** The prisoner will receive a deduction of **two-fifths (2/5)** of their remaining sentence. If they escape but surrender within 48 hours, they will receive a deduction of **one-fifth (1/5)** of their remaining sentence.

### D. Time Allowance for Study, Teaching, or Mentoring (TASTM)
- A prisoner can also earn an additional deduction of **15 days** for each month they spend studying, teaching, or mentoring other inmates.

### E. Who is in charge of GCTA?
- The Director of BuCor, the Chief of the BJMP, and the Wardens of provincial jails are responsible for the grant of GCTA. They are required to establish a Management, Screening, and Evaluation Committee (MSEC) to assess, evaluate, and grant the time allowances.

### F. Irrevocability
Once granted, a GCTA credit **cannot be revoked**.

## Conclusion

Executive Clemency and the Good Conduct Time Allowance are two crucial mechanisms that provide hope and incentive for prisoners. Executive Clemency, an act of mercy from the highest office of the land, offers a path to forgiveness and sentence reduction for deserving individuals. GCTA, on the other hand, is a powerful management tool that is earned by the inmate themselves. It empowers prisoners by giving them a tangible way to reduce their own sentences through good behavior and active participation in their rehabilitation. Together, these mechanisms play a vital role in the correctional system, upholding the principles of justice and providing pathways for redemption and a second chance at life.
