## I. The Importance of Police Ethics

- **Public Trust:** The police cannot function effectively without the trust and confidence of the public. Ethical conduct is the bedrock of that trust. When police act unethically, they erode public trust, which makes citizens less willing to cooperate and report crimes.
- **Legitimacy:** Ethical behavior is what gives the police their legitimacy in the eyes of the public. It is the difference between a professional police force and a group of armed bullies.
- **Professionalism:** A commitment to ethical principles is a hallmark of any true profession.
- **Internal Discipline:** A strong ethical culture within a police department reduces corruption, misconduct, and internal conflicts.

## III. RA 6713: The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees

RA 6713, enacted in 1989, establishes a uniform code of conduct for **all** officials and employees of the government, including members of the PNP. It sets out eight fundamental norms of conduct.

### The Eight Norms of Conduct under RA 6713

1.  **Commitment to Public Interest:**
    - All public officials must prioritize the public interest over their own personal interest.

2.  **Professionalism:**
    - Officials must perform their duties with the highest degree of excellence, intelligence, and skill. They must render service to everyone, without discrimination.

3.  **Justness and Sincerity:**
    - Officials must remain true to the people at all times. They must act with justice and sincerity and shall not discriminate against anyone, especially the poor and the underprivileged.

4.  **Political Neutrality:**
    - Public officials shall provide service to everyone without unfair discrimination and regardless of party affiliation or preference.

5.  **Responsiveness to the Public:**
    - Officials must be responsive to the needs of the public and must provide information to the public quickly and courteously. This includes the requirement to respond to letters and requests within **fifteen (15) working days** of receipt.

6.  **Nationalism and Patriotism:**
    - Officials must be loyal to the Republic and to the Filipino people at all times. They shall endeavor to be modest in their lives.

## Conclusion

Police ethics are not an optional extra; they are the very essence of professional law enforcement. A police force that lacks a strong ethical foundation will inevitably lose the trust of the community it is sworn to protect. The principles outlined in the PNP's own code of conduct and the universal norms mandated by RA 6713 provide a clear roadmap for honorable public service. These codes demand that every police officer, and indeed every public servant, act with integrity, impartiality, professionalism, and a profound commitment to the public interest. Upholding these standards is the only way to maintain the legitimacy and honor of the police profession.

## Introduction

A police officer is granted extraordinary powers by the state—the power to arrest, to use force, and to take a life. With this great power comes the absolute requirement of great responsibility. **Police Ethics** is the branch of philosophy that studies the moral principles and standards of conduct that must guide police officers in the exercise of their duties. It is the foundation of public trust. This module will explore the core principles of police ethics, the specific standards outlined in the PNP's own code of conduct, and the overarching norms of conduct for all public officials and employees as mandated by **Republic Act No. 6713**.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define police ethics and explain its importance.
- Identify the core values of the Philippine National Police.
- Describe the key principles of the PNP Code of Professional Conduct and Ethical Standards.
- List and explain the eight norms of conduct for public officials under RA 6713.


## II. The PNP Code of Professional Conduct and Ethical Standards

The PNP has its own detailed code of conduct that all members are sworn to uphold. This code is rooted in the PNP's core values.

### A. The PNP Core Values
The work of every PNP member is guided by four core values, represented by the acronym **"Maka-Diyos, Makabayan, Makatao, at Makakalikasan"** (For God, Country, People, and the Environment). However, for practical purposes, the police service focuses on:
1.  **Service**
2.  **Honor**
3.  **Justice**

A more practical, day-to-day set of values includes:
- **Discipline**
- **Gentlemanliness**
- **Knowledge**
- **Integrity**
- **Loyalty**
- **Humility**

### B. Key Canons of Police Ethics
The PNP code outlines several key principles:
1.  **Primacy of Public Service:** The police officer's primary duty is to serve the public. They must place the welfare of the public above their own.
2.  **Respect for the Rule of Law:** Police officers are not above the law; they are its primary enforcers and must be its primary adherents. They must obey the law and respect the constitutional rights of all persons.
3.  **Impartiality:** Officers must enforce the law without fear or favor, prejudice or malice. They must not allow their personal feelings or biases to influence their official decisions.
4.  **Use of Force:** The authority to use force must be exercised with restraint and only when necessary. Officers must use only the minimum amount of force required to accomplish a legitimate police purpose.
5.  **Confidentiality:** Information that an officer learns in the course of their duties must be kept confidential, unless its disclosure is required by law.
6.  **Integrity and Incorruptibility:** Police officers must be honest in thought and in deed. They must refuse to accept any gift, bribe, or favor that could compromise their impartiality.


## IV. Prohibited Acts and Transactions under RA 6713

In addition to the norms of conduct, RA 6713 also specifies prohibited acts:

- **Financial and Material Interest:** A public official cannot have any financial or material interest in any transaction requiring the approval of their office.
- **Outside Employment:** An official cannot engage in any outside employment or private business that is in conflict with their official duties.
- **Solicitation or Acceptance of Gifts:** Officials are strictly prohibited from soliciting or accepting, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, loan, or anything of monetary value in the course of their official duties, especially if it is from a person who may be affected by their official actions.
