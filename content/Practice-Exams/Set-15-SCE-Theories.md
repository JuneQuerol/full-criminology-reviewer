### Which school of criminology posits that crime is a result of a rational calculation of costs and benefits?

- [ ] Positivist School
- [x] Classical School
- [ ] Chicago School
- [ ] Critical Criminology

> Explanation: The Classical School, led by thinkers like Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham, argues that individuals are rational beings who choose to commit crimes after weighing the potential pleasure against the potential pain (punishment).

### According to Sutherland's Differential Association Theory, criminal behavior is:

- [ ] A result of biological defects.
- [x] Learned in interaction with other persons in a process of communication.
- [ ] Caused by a lack of self-control.
- [ ] A product of societal conflict.

> Explanation: Sutherland's theory proposes that criminal behavior is learned through social interaction within intimate personal groups. The learning includes techniques of committing the crime and the specific direction of motives, drives, rationalizations, and attitudes.

### The concept of "anomie," a state of normlessness and social breakdown, was primarily developed by:

- [ ] Karl Marx
- [ ] Cesare Lombroso
- [x] Emile Durkheim
- [ ] Travis Hirschi

> Explanation: Emile Durkheim introduced the concept of anomie to describe a condition where social norms are weak, conflicting, or absent, leading to a sense of deregulation and a higher likelihood of deviant behavior.

### Robert Merton's Strain Theory argues that crime occurs when:

- [ ] A person's bonds to society are weak or broken.
- [ ] A person learns pro-criminal definitions.
- [x] There is a disjunction between culturally prescribed goals and the legitimate means to achieve them.
- [ ] There is a lack of capable guardians.

> Explanation: Merton's theory suggests that society puts pressure on individuals to achieve success (the goal) but does not provide equal access to legitimate means (like education or good jobs). This strain can lead individuals to resort to illegitimate means, such as crime.

### The study of the role of the victim in the criminal event is called:

- [ ] Criminology
- [x] Victimology
- [ ] Penology
- [ ] Sociology

> Explanation: Victimology is a subfield of criminology that scientifically studies the relationship between the victim and the offender, the justice system, and the social context of the crime.

### Which theory suggests that crime is more likely to occur in neighborhoods with physical and social decay, where residents are disengaged?

- [x] Broken Windows Theory
- [ ] Social Disorganization Theory
- [ ] Strain Theory
- [ ] Labeling Theory

> Explanation: Popularized by Wilson and Kelling, the "Broken Windows" theory posits that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder (like broken windows, graffiti, and litter) create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder.

### In the context of juvenile justice, what does "parens patriae" mean?

- [ ] "An eye for an eye."
- [x] "The state as the parent."
- [ ] "Guilty mind."
- [ ] "Let the decision stand."

> Explanation: The doctrine of parens patriae gives the state the power to act as a guardian for minors and others who are unable to care for themselves. It is the philosophical basis for the juvenile court system, allowing the state to intervene in the best interests of the child.

### A child who violates a law that only applies to minors, such as truancy or running away, is known as a:

- [ ] Delinquent offender
- [x] Status offender
- [ ] Youthful perpetrator
- [ ] Socialized delinquent

> Explanation: A status offense is an act that is considered a violation of the law only because of the youth's status as a minor. These acts would not be crimes if committed by an adult.

### According to Hirschi's Social Control Theory, what prevents people from committing crimes?

- [ ] Fear of punishment.
- [x] Strong bonds to conventional society.
- [ ] Lack of criminal opportunity.
- [ ] Rational choice.

> Explanation: Hirschi's theory argues that people refrain from deviance because they have strong social bonds consisting of four elements: attachment to others, commitment to conformity, involvement in conventional activities, and belief in the moral validity of the law.

### The idea that the criminal justice system and its agents can actually perpetuate crime by branding individuals as criminals is central to which theory?

- [ ] Strain Theory
- [x] Labeling Theory
- [ ] Differential Association Theory
- [ ] Routine Activities Theory

> Explanation: Labeling theory suggests that when society applies a deviant label to an individual (e.g., "criminal," "junkie"), that person may internalize the label, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy where they engage in more deviant behavior.

### The "holy trinity" of Criminology (theorists) are often considered to be:

- [ ] Marx, Weber, and Durkheim
- [x] Lombroso, Ferri, and Garofalo
- [ ] Beccaria, Bentham, and Blackstone
- [ ] Freud, Jung, and Adler

> Explanation: Cesare Lombroso, Enrico Ferri, and Raffaele Garofalo are considered the "fathers" of the Italian School of Positivist Criminology, which sought to explain crime through scientific (biological, social, psychological) factors.

### This branch of ethics is concerned with the specific moral principles and codes of conduct that govern a profession.

- [ ] Meta-ethics
- [ ] Normative ethics
- [x] Professional ethics
- [ ] Descriptive ethics

> Explanation: Professional ethics establishes the standards of conduct, integrity, and duty expected of members of a particular profession, such as law enforcement.

### The concept of "victim precipitation" suggests that:

- [ ] Victims are always blameless.
- [x] The victim may, in some way, have initiated the confrontation that led to their victimization.
- [ ] All victims deserve compensation.
- [ ] Victims and offenders are the same.

> Explanation: Victim precipitation is a controversial theory that examines the extent to which a victim's actions or characteristics may have contributed to or provoked the criminal act. It does not mean the victim is at fault, but rather analyzes the interactional dynamics.

### Which of the following is NOT a requirement of the "crime triangle" in Routine Activities Theory?

- [x] A history of prior offending
- [ ] A motivated offender
- [ ] A suitable target
- [ ] The absence of a capable guardian

> Explanation: Routine Activities Theory posits that for a crime to occur, three elements must converge in space and time: a motivated offender, a suitable target (a person or object), and the absence of a capable guardian who could prevent the crime.

### A police officer who accepts a free coffee from a restaurant owner is engaging in what level of corruption?

- [ ] Criminal enterprise
- [x] Gratuity
- [ ] Bribery
- [ ] Extortion

> Explanation: Accepting gratuities (small, unsolicited gifts or favors) is considered a minor form of corruption, but it is often prohibited because it can create a sense of obligation and erode public trust.

### The "Positivist School" of criminology, led by Lombroso, famously argued that criminals were:

- [ ] Rational actors making a choice.
- [x] "Atavistic" throwbacks to an earlier, more primitive stage of human evolution.
- [ ] Products of a capitalist society.
- [ ] Lacking in social bonds.

> Explanation: Lombroso's theory of the "born criminal" suggested that criminality was inherited and that some individuals were biologically predisposed to crime, identifiable by certain physical stigmata or defects.

### What does the "Code of Silence" or "Blue Wall of Silence" refer to in police ethics?

- [ ] The rule against talking to the media.
- [x] An informal code of loyalty where officers refuse to report or testify against a colleague's misconduct.
- [ ] A vow taken by new recruits.
- [ ] The confidentiality required during an internal investigation.

> Explanation: The "Blue Wall of Silence" is a deeply problematic ethical issue where police officers protect one another from internal or external investigation, even in cases of clear misconduct.

### Victimology focuses on the study of the victim. What is a key component of victim assistance programs?

- [ ] Helping the victim get revenge.
- [x] Providing crisis intervention, counseling, and financial compensation.
- [ ] Investigating the crime on behalf of the victim.
- [ ] Training the victim in self-defense.

> Explanation: Victim assistance programs aim to help victims cope with the aftermath of a crime by providing services like emergency shelter, medical care, counseling, and guidance through the criminal justice process.

### According to Gottfredson and Hirschi's General Theory of Crime, the root cause of all criminal behavior is:

- [ ] Social strain
- [ ] Deviant labels
- [x] Low self-control
- [ ] Economic inequality

> Explanation: This theory argues that low self-control, established in early childhood, is the single most important factor predicting criminality and other analogous, risky behaviors throughout life.

### The ethical principle that requires fairness, equity, and impartiality in the treatment of all individuals is known as:

- [ ] Beneficence
- [x] Justice
- [ ] Autonomy
- [ ] Non-maleficence

> Explanation: Justice, in an ethical context, demands that individuals be treated fairly and given what they are due. In law enforcement, this means applying the law equally to all.

### This theory suggests that society is composed of different groups in conflict over resources, power, and status, and that the law is a tool used by the powerful to control the powerless.

- [ ] Social Control Theory
- [x] Conflict Theory
- [ ] Strain Theory
- [ ] Labeling Theory

> Explanation: Conflict theories, rooted in the work of Karl Marx, view crime as a product of the inherent inequalities and power struggles within society. The state and the law are seen as instruments of the ruling class.

### A repeat offender is also known as a:

- [ ] First-time offender
- [x] Recidivist
- [ ] Status offender
- [ ] Professional criminal

> Explanation: A recidivist is a person who relapses into criminal behavior, often after receiving sanctions or undergoing intervention for a previous crime. Recidivism is the act of re-offending.

### The ethical duty to be truthful and honest is known as:

- [x] Veracity
- [ ] Fidelity
- [ ] Gratitude
- [ ] Justice

> Explanation: Veracity is the principle of truthfulness. In a professional context like law enforcement, it means being honest in all communications and actions.

### The "age of onset" is a key concept in which area of criminology?

- [x] Developmental or Life-Course Criminology
- [ ] Classical Criminology
- [ ] Feminist Criminology
- [ ] Environmental Criminology

> Explanation: Developmental theories, like those proposed by Sampson and Laub or Moffitt, study the onset, persistence, and desistance from crime over the course of an individual's life. The age at which criminal behavior begins ("age of onset") is a crucial predictor of future behavior.

### Which of the following is an example of "victimless crime"?

- [ ] Theft
- [ ] Assault
- [x] Illegal gambling
- [ ] Homicide

> Explanation: A "victimless crime" is an offense that is argued to have no direct victim other than possibly the perpetrator themselves. Examples include prostitution, illegal drug use, and gambling. The term is controversial, as many argue there are indirect victims.

### The principle of "proportionality" in sentencing, a key idea from the Classical School, means that:

- [ ] The punishment should be as severe as possible.
- [x] The punishment must fit the crime.
- [ ] The punishment should be determined by the victim.
- [ ] The offender's background should be the primary consideration.

> Explanation: Beccaria argued that for punishment to be a just and effective deterrent, it must be proportionate to the harm caused by the crime. Severe, arbitrary punishment is counterproductive.

### What is the term for the unwritten rules and values that are the "real" guides for police behavior, as opposed to the official, written rules?

- [ ] The penal code
- [x] The police subculture
- [ ] The procedural manual
- [ ] The city ordinance

> Explanation: The police subculture is the informal set of values, beliefs, and norms that shape how officers perceive their work and interact with each other and the public. It can sometimes be at odds with official policy and professional ethics.

### The theory that crime is a product of social learning and the observation of others, particularly through media, is a component of:

- [ ] Anomie Theory
- [x] Social Learning Theory
- [ ] Control Theory
- [ ] Labeling Theory

> Explanation: Developed by Albert Bandura, social learning theory posits that people can learn new behaviors, including criminal ones, by observing and imitating others (modeling), particularly when that behavior is reinforced.

### A police officer who actively seeks out opportunities for financial gain through their position is known as a:

- [ ] "Grass-eater"
- [x] "Meat-eater"
- [ ] "Blue-coat" criminal
- [ ] "Rogue cop"

> Explanation: The Knapp Commission, which investigated corruption in the NYPD, distinguished between "grass-eaters" (who passively accept unsolicited gratuities) and "meat-eaters" (who aggressively misuse their police power for personal gain).

### The ethical framework that judges the morality of an action based on its adherence to rules is called:

- [x] Deontology
- [ ] Consequentialism (or Utilitarianism)
- [ ] Virtue Ethics
- [ ] Relativism

> Explanation: Deontology, famously associated with Immanuel Kant, argues that actions are morally right or wrong based on whether they follow a set of rules or duties, regardless of the consequences. For police, this means following the law and departmental rules is a moral duty.
