title: 'Practice Exam: Criminalistics - Ballistics & Firearms Identification (Set 22)'
description: 'A 30-question practice exam covering firearms examination, ballistic analysis, and gunshot wound interpretation.'
---

### 1. In ballistic analysis, what is the term for the minute scratches and imperfections on the surface of a bullet, which are unique to a specific firearm barrel?

- [ ] Lands and Grooves
- [x] Striations
- [ ] Caliber markings
- [ ] Breech face marks

> Explanation: Striations, also known as striae, are the microscopic scratches produced on a bullet as it travels down the barrel. These are considered the "fingerprints" of a firearm, as they are unique to each barrel and can be used to match a bullet to a specific gun.

### 2. Which type of ballistics deals with the motion and effects of the projectile from the moment it leaves the muzzle of the firearm until it strikes the target?

- [ ] Interior Ballistics
- [x] Exterior Ballistics
- [ ] Terminal Ballistics
- [ ] Forensic Ballistics

> Explanation: Exterior ballistics is the study of a projectile's flight through the air. It is affected by factors like gravity, air resistance (drag), and wind, which determine the bullet's trajectory and stability.

### 3. A firearm is found at a crime scene. What is the most critical first step for the investigator to ensure the integrity of the evidence?

- [ ] Unload the weapon immediately.
- [x] Document its condition and location, and render it safe without compromising evidence.
- [ ] Dust the firearm for fingerprints.
- [ ] Test-fire the weapon to check its functionality.

> Explanation: The primary rule in handling firearm evidence is to preserve its evidentiary value. This involves documenting its exact state (e.g., hammer cocked, safety on/off) and location before making it safe. Unloading it improperly or dusting for prints before a full examination can destroy trace evidence like DNA or GSR.

### 4. Under RA 10591, what is the classification for a person who owns and possesses more than fifteen (15) registered firearms?

- [ ] Antique Firearm Collector
- [x] Gun Collector
- [ ] Sports Shooter
- [ ] Licensed Citizen

> Explanation: Section 3(s) of RA 10591, the "Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act," defines a "Gun Collector" as a licensed citizen who owns and possesses more than fifteen (15) registered firearms.

### 5. A gunshot wound shows a distinct "stellate" or star-shaped pattern, with soot and powder particles embedded deep within the wound track. What is the most likely range of fire?

- [ ] Distant shot
- [ ] Near-contact shot
- [x] Contact shot (hard contact)
- [ ] Intermediate range shot

> Explanation: A hard contact wound, where the muzzle is pressed firmly against the skin, causes hot gases from the muzzle to be forced into the subcutaneous tissue. This gas expands, tearing the skin and creating the characteristic stellate pattern.

### 6. What part of a cartridge case is struck by the firing pin, initiating the discharge sequence?

- [ ] The bullet
- [ ] The case wall
- [x] The primer
- [ ] The rim

> Explanation: The primer is a small, sensitive explosive cap located at the base of the cartridge case. When the firing pin strikes the primer, it detonates, igniting the main gunpowder charge and propelling the bullet.

### 7. Comparison microscopy is used in firearms identification to compare a test-fired bullet with a bullet recovered from a crime scene. What is the primary characteristic being compared?

- [ ] The weight and caliber of the bullets.
- [x] The microscopic striations on the bullets' surfaces.
- [ ] The composition of the lead alloy.
- [ ] The shape of the bullets (e.g., round nose, hollow point).

> Explanation: A comparison microscope allows a firearms examiner to view two bullets side-by-side. The examiner looks for a sufficient correlation of the unique microscopic striations (striae) to conclude that both bullets were fired from the same barrel.

### 8. Which of the following is an example of an "individual characteristic" of a firearm's barrel?

- [ ] The number of lands and grooves.
- [ ] The direction of twist (e.g., right or left).
- [ ] The caliber of the barrel.
- [x] A specific, accidental nick or scratch inside the barrel.

> Explanation: Individual characteristics are unique imperfections or markings produced accidentally during manufacture or use. A specific scratch inside the barrel will impart a unique mark on every bullet fired through it. Class characteristics, like the number of grooves or twist direction, are shared by a group of firearms from the same manufacturer.

### 9. Gunshot Residue (GSR) is composed of particles from the primer, propellant, and the firearm itself. What are the three key elements a forensic chemist typically looks for in a positive GSR test using SEM-EDX?

- [ ] Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen
- [ ] Iron, Copper, Zinc
- [x] Lead (Pb), Antimony (Sb), and Barium (Ba)
- [ ] Brass, Steel, and Lead

> Explanation: Modern primers contain a mixture that includes lead styphnate, antimony sulfide, and barium nitrate. The presence of all three elements in a single microscopic particle is considered characteristic of and specific to gunshot residue.

### 10. The helical grooves cut into the interior of a barrel are known as rifling. What is their primary purpose?

- [ ] To decrease the speed of the bullet.
- [ ] To mark the bullet for identification.
- [x] To impart a spin on the bullet, stabilizing it in flight.
- [ ] To increase the sound of the gunshot.

> Explanation: Rifling imparts a gyroscopic spin to the bullet. This spin stabilizes the projectile, preventing it from tumbling end over end and ensuring it flies point-forward, which dramatically increases its accuracy and range.

### 11. What is "breech face marking" on a cartridge case?

- [ ] Markings left by the magazine lips.
- [x] Markings transferred from the firearm's breechblock to the base of the cartridge during firing.
- [ ] Scratches from the ejector and extractor.
- [ ] The manufacturer's headstamp.

> Explanation: When a firearm is discharged, the immense pressure forces the base of the cartridge case backward against the breech face (or breechblock). The texture and any imperfections on the breech face are impressed onto the soft metal of the cartridge's primer cup and head, creating unique and identifiable marks.

### 12. In the Philippines, what is the government agency responsible for the issuance of firearm licenses and the regulation of firearms and ammunition?

- [ ] The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)
- [ ] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)
- [x] The Philippine National Police - Firearms and Explosives Office (PNP-FEO)
- [ ] The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG)

> Explanation: The PNP-FEO is the sole repository of all firearms records and is mandated by RA 10591 to issue licenses, permits, and regulate firearms and ammunition for civilians.

### 13. A bullet is fired into a block of ballistic gelatin. The study of the wound track, energy transfer, and projectile deformation within the gelatin falls under which category?

- [ ] Exterior Ballistics
- [x] Terminal Ballistics
- [ ] Wound Ballistics
- [ ] Interior Ballistics

> Explanation: Terminal ballistics (often used interchangeably with wound ballistics) is the study of what happens when a projectile hits its target. It focuses on the projectile's behavior upon impact, including penetration, fragmentation, and the transfer of kinetic energy to the target medium.

### 14. What does the term "caliber" generally refer to?

- [ ] The length of the firearm barrel.
- [ ] The weight of the bullet in grains.
- [x] The approximate diameter of the barrel's bore.
- [ ] The number of cartridges a firearm can hold.

> Explanation: Caliber refers to the nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel, and by extension, the diameter of the projectile it fires. It is typically measured in inches (e.g., .45 caliber) or millimeters (e.g., 9mm).

### 15. An unfired cartridge is found at a scene. Which of the following marks would generally NOT be found on it?

- [ ] Magazine lip striations
- [ ] Extractor marks
- [x] Firing pin impression
- [ ] Ejector marks

> Explanation: A firing pin impression is only created when the trigger is pulled and the hammer or striker hits the primer, firing the cartridge. Extractor and ejector marks, as well as magazine striations, can be created simply by the action of chambering and then ejecting a live round without firing it.

### 16. What is trajectory analysis in a shooting investigation primarily concerned with?

- [ ] The emotional state of the shooter.
- [ ] The speed of the bullet upon impact.
- [x] The path of the bullet from the muzzle to its final resting place.
- [ ] The type of firearm used.

> Explanation: Trajectory analysis involves determining the flight path of a projectile. By examining bullet holes in objects (walls, windows, bodies), investigators can reconstruct the bullet's path to estimate the location of the shooter.

### 17. The raised portions of metal between the grooves inside a rifled barrel are called:

- [ ] Striae
- [x] Lands
- [ ] Ridges
- [ ] Calibers

> Explanation: When a barrel is rifled, grooves are cut into its surface. The remaining raised portions are called lands. The lands are what actually grip the bullet to impart spin.

### 18. A "tattooing" or "stippling" pattern around a gunshot wound is caused by what?

- [ ] The impact of the bullet itself.
- [ ] The flame from the muzzle blast.
- [x] Unburned and partially burned gunpowder particles striking the skin.
- [ ] The shockwave created by the projectile.

> Explanation: Tattooing (or stippling) is a characteristic of intermediate-range gunshot wounds. It consists of multiple small abrasions on the skin caused by the impact of individual powder grains that exit the muzzle along with the bullet but do not burn completely.

### 19. According to RA 10591, what is the maximum number of ammunition a licensed citizen is allowed to possess for each registered firearm at any given time?

- [ ] 20 rounds
- [x] 50 rounds
- [ ] 100 rounds
- [ ] Unlimited, as long as it is for personal use.

> Explanation: Section 11 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 10591 states that the "license to possess a firearm... shall include the authority to possess ammunition... not exceeding fifty (50) rounds per firearm" for Type 1 to Type 5 licenses.

### 20. What is the main purpose of the "chain of custody" for a piece of firearm evidence?

- [ ] To determine the market value of the firearm.
- [ ] To clean and repair the firearm for testing.
- [x] To create a continuous, documented record of who has handled the evidence from collection to trial.
- [ ] To publish the details of the evidence for the public.

> Explanation: The chain of custody is a legal and procedural requirement that ensures the accountability and integrity of evidence. It is a chronological paper trail showing the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence. A broken chain can lead to evidence being ruled inadmissible in court.

### 21. Which type of handgun characteristically ejects its spent cartridge cases after each shot?

- [ ] Revolver
- [x] Semiautomatic Pistol
- [ ] Derringer
- [ ] Single-shot pistol

> Explanation: Semiautomatic pistols use the energy of the fired shot (gas or recoil) to cycle the action, which involves extracting the spent cartridge case, ejecting it, and loading a fresh cartridge from the magazine. Revolvers retain their spent cases in the cylinder until manually unloaded.

### 22. What does the "gauge" of a shotgun refer to?

- [ ] The length of the barrel in inches.
- [ ] The number of pellets in a standard shell.
- [x] The number of lead balls of the bore's diameter that would equal one pound.
- [ ] The maximum effective range in yards.

> Explanation: Gauge is a traditional unit of measure for shotgun bores. For example, a 12-gauge shotgun has a bore diameter equal to that of a solid lead sphere weighing 1/12th of a pound. A smaller gauge number means a larger barrel diameter.

### 23. A firearms examiner uses a special tank of water to obtain test-fired bullets. What is the primary reason for using water?

- [ ] To clean the bullet of any residue.
- [x] To decelerate the bullet without damaging its microscopic striations.
- [ ] To cool the bullet down quickly.
- [ ] To measure the bullet's velocity.

> Explanation: Water provides a medium that effectively and safely stops a high-velocity bullet while preserving the fine details of the striations on its surface. Firing into sand, wood, or other materials would damage or obliterate these crucial markings needed for comparison.

### 24. A distinct ring of residue around a bullet hole on a target, known as "bullet wipe," is primarily composed of what?

- [ ] Lead from the bullet core.
- [x] A mixture of carbon, dirt, lubricant, and lead from the bullet's surface.
- [ ] Rust from the inside of the barrel.
- [ ] Melted plastic from a shotshell wad.

> Explanation: As a bullet travels down the barrel and through the air, it picks up lubricant, dirt, and residue. When it passes through a target (like fabric or wood), this residue is wiped off onto the edges of the hole, creating a dark ring known as bullet wipe.

### 25. The study of the processes that occur from the ignition of the propellant until the projectile exits the barrel is known as:

- [ ] Forensic Ballistics
- [x] Interior Ballistics
- [ ] Exterior Ballistics
- [ ] Terminal Ballistics

> Explanation: Interior ballistics covers everything that happens inside the firearm. This includes the ignition of the primer, the burning of the propellant, the buildup of pressure, the acceleration of the bullet down the barrel, and the engraving of rifling marks onto the bullet.

### 26. Which of the following is considered a "class characteristic" of a firearm?

- [ ] A broken firing pin tip.
- [ ] A scratch on the breech face.
- [x] The number of lands and grooves in the barrel.
- [ ] A unique wear pattern on the ejector.

> Explanation: Class characteristics are intentional design features shared by a particular model or group of firearms. For example, all Colt M1911 pistols have barrels with 6 grooves and a left-hand twist. Individual characteristics are unique, accidental markings.

### 27. Under Philippine law (RA 10591), a firearm that is more than fifty (50) years old and serves as a historical object is classified as what?

- [ ] A legacy firearm
- [ ] A restricted firearm
- [x] An antique firearm
- [ ] An unserviceable firearm

> Explanation: Section 3(b) of RA 10591 defines an "antique firearm" as one which is fifty (50) years old or older, has been certified as such by the National Museum, and meets other specific criteria relating to its collection and historical significance.

### 28. What is the term for the outward beveling of bone on the exit side of a gunshot wound to the skull?

- [ ] Keyhole defect
- [x] Funneling effect
- [ ] Caliber deformation
- [ ] Radiating fracture

> Explanation: When a bullet passes through a flat bone like the skull, it typically creates a "funnel" effect. The entry hole on the outer table of the skull is smaller and more rounded, while the exit hole on the inner table is larger and more beveled or cone-shaped. This helps forensic pathologists determine the direction of fire.

### 29. A spent shotgun shell is recovered at a scene. What part of the shell can provide class characteristics linking it to a specific type of shotgun?

- [ ] The color of the plastic hull.
- [x] The firing pin impression and breech face marks on the primer.
- [ ] The printed text on the hull.
- [ ] The crimp style (e.g., star or roll).

> Explanation: Just like with cartridge cases, the firing pin and breech face of a shotgun will leave unique or class-specific marks on the soft metal primer cap at the base of the shell. These can be used to match the shell to the gun that fired it.

### 30. If a person is caught in possession of a loaded firearm in a public place during an election gun ban period, what crime may they be charged with in addition to illegal possession?

- [ ] Public disturbance
- [ ] Sedition
- [x] Violation of the Omnibus Election Code
- [ ] Disobedience to an agent of a person in authority

> Explanation: The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) regularly imposes a nationwide gun ban during election periods as authorized by the Omnibus Election Code. Carrying a firearm outside one's residence or place of business without written authority from the COMELEC during this period is a specific election offense, separate from the penalties under RA 10591.
