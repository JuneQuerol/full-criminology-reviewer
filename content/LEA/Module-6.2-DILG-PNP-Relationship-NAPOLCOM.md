## I. The Civilian Character of the Police

A core principle of modern Philippine policing is its **civilian character**. This means the police are not part of the military and are subject to the authority of the civilian government. RA 6975 firmly established this by placing the PNP under the DILG.

- **DILG:** An executive department of the civilian government.
- **NAPOLCOM:** A civilian-led commission responsible for policy-making and oversight.
- **PNP:** The national, civilian police force.

This structure prevents the militarization of law enforcement and ensures that the police force is accountable to the people it serves, through their elected and appointed civilian officials.

**Board Exam Tip:** Questions frequently test the concept of the "civilian character" of the PNP. Remember that this principle is the primary reason the PNP was moved from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to the DILG.

## III. The National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM)

NAPOLCOM is the agency mandated to administer and control the PNP. It is an collegial body attached to the DILG for policy and program coordination. The term "attached" means it retains a degree of independence in its decision-making, even though its Chairperson is the DILG Secretary.

### A. Composition of NAPOLCOM
The Commission is composed of a Chairperson, four (4) regular Commissioners, and the Chief of the PNP as an *ex-officio* member.

| Member | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chairperson** | The Secretary of the DILG (by virtue of position) |
| **Vice-Chairperson** | A civilian appointed by the President |
| **Four Regular Commissioners** | Appointed by the President for a fixed term of 6 years |
| **Ex-officio Member** | The Chief of the PNP (non-voting) |

## IV. PNP: Operational Autonomy and Accountability

While under the DILG and NAPOLCOM, the PNP maintains a degree of operational autonomy necessary for effective law enforcement.

### A. The Chief, PNP
- The head of the PNP with the rank of Police General.
- He has the power to **command and direct** the PNP.
- He is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the police force.
- He is accountable to the President, the DILG Secretary, and NAPOLCOM.

### B. The Command Structure
- The PNP has its own internal chain of command, from the Chief, PNP down to the lowest-ranking patrolman.
- This ensures that operational orders are transmitted efficiently and that there is clear accountability for actions taken in the field.

**The DILG-NAPOLCOM-PNP Triad**

| Entity | Role | Relationship |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DILG** | **Administrative Control:** Overall departmental authority, budget, and policy alignment. | The DILG Secretary is the head of the department that "houses" the PNP and also chairs NAPOLCOM. |
| **NAPOLCOM** | **Policy & Oversight:** Sets standards, administers exams, and acts as an appellate body. Exercises administrative control & operational supervision. | An "attached" agency to DILG, it provides a specialized, collegial body to oversee the police. |
| **PNP** | **Operations:** Enforces the law, maintains peace and order, and investigates crimes. | The executing arm, accountable to both DILG and NAPOLCOM for its administration and performance. |

This triad ensures that:
- The PNP's administration is consistent with the policies of the civilian government (via DILG).
- The PNP adheres to professional standards and is subject to external oversight (via NAPOLCOM).
- The PNP has the operational capability to perform its duties effectively (via its own command structure).

## Introduction

Understanding the precise relationship between the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM), and the Philippine National Police (PNP) is fundamental to the study of Law Enforcement Administration in the Philippines. This module dissects the legal framework established by RA 6975 and its amendments, clarifying the roles, powers, and functions of each entity. We will explore how these three bodies interact to ensure the PNP remains a civilian force, accountable, and effective in its mission.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define the "triad of police administration" in the Philippine context.
- Explain the role of the DILG Secretary over the PNP.
- Detail the composition, powers, and functions of the NAPOLCOM.
- Distinguish between administrative control and operational supervision.
- Analyze how these relationships ensure the civilian character of the police.


## II. The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG)

The DILG is the executive department responsible for promoting peace and order, ensuring public safety, and strengthening local government capability aimed at the effective delivery of basic services to the citizenry.

### A. The DILG Secretary's Authority
The Secretary of the DILG holds a significant position of authority over the PNP. Under RA 6975, the DILG Secretary is the *ex-officio* Chairman of the National Police Commission.

**Power of Administrative Control:**
The DILG Secretary exercises **administrative control** over the PNP. This includes:
- The power to organize and reorganize the PNP for maximum efficiency.
- The power to issue directives and guidelines.
- The power to review and approve the PNP's budget proposals.
- The power to affirm, reverse, or modify disciplinary decisions.

### B. DILG's Role in Police Administration
- **Budgetary Oversight:** The DILG ensures the PNP's budget is aligned with national priorities and is spent accountably.
- **Policy Implementation:** The DILG acts as the implementing arm for policies and programs that affect the PNP and local governments.
- **Coordination:** The DILG facilitates coordination between the PNP and Local Government Units (LGUs), especially in the context of community-based crime prevention programs.

**Key Point:** The DILG Secretary's power is one of *control*, not direct command. The day-to-day running of the PNP is left to the Chief, PNP, but the overall administration is under the DILG's purview.

| **Chairperson** | The Secretary of the DILG (Ex-Officio). |
| **Vice Chairperson & Exec. Officer** | A regular commissioner designated by the President. |
| **4 Regular Commissioners** | Appointed by the President. At least one must be a woman. Three must be regular members of the Philippine Bar. |
| **1 Ex-Officio Member** | The Chief of the PNP. |

**Important Qualifications for Commissioners:**
- Citizens of the Philippines.
- Persons of known probity and integrity.
- Must not have been a candidate for any elective position in the preceding election.
- A member of the Philippine Bar with at least five years of experience is required for three of the four regular commissioners.

### B. Key Powers and Functions of NAPOLCOM
NAPOLCOM's functions are broad and are central to the professionalization and administration of the PNP.

**1. Policy Making:**
- Formulates policies, plans, and standards for the PNP on recruitment, promotion, and discipline.
- Prescribes the minimum standards for arms, equipment, and uniforms.

**2. Administration of Examinations:**
- Conducts the **PNP Entrance Examination** for police applicants.
- Conducts **Promotional Examinations** for police officers seeking promotion to higher ranks.

**3. Disciplinary Authority:**
- **Appellate Body:** NAPOLCOM serves as the appellate body for disciplinary cases decided by the Chief, PNP, and other subordinates.
- **Summary Dismissal Power:** The NAPOLCOM en banc has the power to summarily dismiss PNP members for serious offenses.

**4. Inspection and Audit:**
- Conducts regular inspections and management audits of all PNP units to assess their effectiveness and compliance with standards.

**5. Other Key Functions:**
- Approves the PNP's organizational structure and staffing pattern.
- Recommends to the President, from among a list of senior PNP officers, candidates for the position of Chief, PNP.

**Board Exam Tip:** Differentiate between the DILG's *administrative control* and NAPOLCOM's *administrative control and operational supervision*. RA 8551 strengthened NAPOLCOM by giving it greater administrative and supervisory powers to institutionalize police reforms.


## V. The Triad: A System of Checks and Balances

The relationship between the DILG, NAPOLCOM, and the PNP creates a system of checks and balances designed to prevent abuse of power and ensure accountability.

| Entity | Primary Role | Key Relationship |

## Conclusion

The DILG, NAPOLCOM, and PNP form a complex but crucial administrative structure. The DILG provides the framework of civilian executive control. NAPOLCOM acts as the specialized body for policy-making, standardization, and discipline, ensuring professionalization. The PNP, in turn, is the operational arm tasked with direct law enforcement. Mastering the specific powers and inter-relationships of this triad is essential for any student of Philippine law enforcement administration and is a recurring topic in the Criminology Licensure Exams.
