## Answer Key & Explanations

**1. C) Controlling the woman's own money or properties**
*   **Explanation:** Economic abuse under RA 9262 includes acts that make or attempt to make a woman financially dependent, which involves controlling her own money or assets. The other options are forms of psychological (a, b) or sexual (d) violence.

**2. B) Temporary Protection Order (TPO)**
*   **Explanation:** A TPO is issued by a court, is effective for 30 days, and is granted *ex parte* (without the respondent's presence) to provide immediate protection while a hearing for a PPO is pending.

**3. C) Spiritual Violence**
*   **Explanation:** RA 9262 defines four types of violence: Physical, Sexual, Psychological, and Economic Abuse. "Spiritual Violence" is not one of them.

**4. B) Public crime, which can be filed by any citizen with personal knowledge**
*   **Explanation:** RA 9262 explicitly states that the crime of VAWC is a public crime. This allows concerned citizens, and not just the victim, to initiate a complaint, ensuring the state's protection for the victim.

**5. A) Battered Woman Syndrome**
*   **Explanation:** RA 9262 recognizes the "Battered Woman Syndrome" as a valid legal defense. A woman suffering from BWS who kills or injures her tormentor is deemed to have acted in self-defense and may be justified in her actions.

**6. B) A woman with whom the offender has or had a sexual or dating relationship, and her child**
*   **Explanation:** The law protects the woman (wife, former wife, or one in a sexual or dating relationship) and her child (whether legitimate or illegitimate).

*   **Explanation:** A Barangay Protection Order (BPO) issued by the Punong Barangay under RA 9262 is effective for a period of fifteen (15) days.

**8. B) Any person below 18 years of age, or those older but unable to fully care for themselves**
*   **Explanation:** RA 7610 defines a "child" as a person below 18 years of age or those over 18 but are unable to fully care for themselves because of a physical or mental disability or condition.

**11. C) Any act which debases, degrades, or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child**
*   **Explanation:** This is a core definition of child abuse under RA 7610, covering acts of emotional and psychological maltreatment, not just physical harm.

**15. C) The purpose is for exploitation, such as forced labor or prostitution**
*   **Explanation:** The three core elements of trafficking are the Act, the Means, and the Purpose. The purpose must always be for exploitation. The other options are not always required (e.g., the victim can be an adult, the act can occur within a country).

**16. C) Never relevant, regardless of whether force was used or not**
*   **Explanation:** Section 4(c) of RA 9208 explicitly states that the consent of a victim to the intended exploitation is irrelevant where any of the "means" (force, fraud, deception, etc.) have been used. For child victims, the means are not even required.

**17. D) All of the above**
*   **Explanation:** RA 9208, as amended, provides for qualified trafficking, which imposes the penalty of life imprisonment, under several circumstances, including when the victim is a child, the crime is committed by a syndicate, or it results in the victim's death.

**18. C) Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT)**
*   **Explanation:** IACAT, co-chaired by the Secretary of Justice and the Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, is the primary body responsible for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the law.

**19. C) Offering a legitimate, high-paying job**
*   **Explanation:** The "means" of trafficking involves negative actions like threat, force, coercion, deception, or abuse of vulnerability. A legitimate job offer is not a means of trafficking, though traffickers may use deceptive job offers as a form of fraud.

**20. C) The separate offense of using the services of a trafficked person**
