## 2. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OVERVIEW

- **Definition**: Criminal procedure is the method prescribed by law for the apprehension and prosecution of persons accused of any criminal offense, and for their punishment, in case of conviction. It governs the series of proceedings from the initiation of criminal action until its finality.

- **Purpose**: To provide a system for the fair and orderly administration of criminal justice, ensuring that the rights of both the state and the accused are protected.

- **Governing Rules**: The primary source of rules for criminal procedure in the Philippines is the **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure**, found in **Rules 110 to 127 of the Rules of Court**.

- **Jurisdiction in Criminal Cases**: For a court to have authority to hear and decide a criminal case, it must have:
    1.  **Jurisdiction over the subject matter**: The authority to hear the type of crime alleged.
    2.  **Jurisdiction over the territory**: The authority to hear cases committed within its geographical boundaries.
    3.  **Jurisdiction over the person of the accused**: Acquired through arrest or voluntary submission.

## 3. PROSECUTION OF OFFENSES (Rule 110)

### A. HOW CRIMINAL ACTIONS ARE INSTITUTED

Criminal actions are initiated either by filing a complaint or an information.

- **For offenses requiring preliminary investigation**: By filing a complaint with the proper officer for the purpose of conducting a preliminary investigation.
- **For all other offenses**: By filing the complaint or information directly with the Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts, or the complaint with the office of the prosecutor.

### B. COMPLAINT

- **Definition**: A sworn written statement charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the offended party, any peace officer, or other public officer charged with the enforcement of the law violated.
- **Contents**:
    1.  Name of the accused.
    2.  Designation of the offense by the statute.
    3.  The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense.
    4.  Name of the offended party.
    5.  The approximate date of the commission of the offense.
    6.  The place where the offense was committed.
- **Who can file**:
    - The offended party.
    - Any peace officer (e.g., police officer).
    - Other public officers charged with enforcing the specific law violated.

### C. INFORMATION

- **Definition**: An accusation in writing charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the prosecutor, and filed with the court.
- **Contents**: The contents are the same as a complaint, but it is signed and endorsed by the prosecutor.
- **Who can file**: Only a **prosecutor** can sign and file an information.
- **Sufficiency of Information**: An information is considered sufficient if it states:
    1.  The name of the accused.
    2.  The designation of the offense.
    3.  The acts constituting the offense.
    4.  The name of the offended party.
    5.  The approximate date and place of the commission.

### D. DESIGNATION OF OFFENSE

- The information must state the designation of the offense as given by the statute.
- **Qualifying and aggravating circumstances** must be specifically alleged in the information. If not alleged, they cannot be considered for imposing a higher penalty, even if proven during the trial. They will be treated as generic aggravating circumstances.

### E. DUPLICITY OF OFFENSE (Rule 110, Sec. 13)

- **General Rule**: A complaint or information must charge only **one offense**.
- **Purpose**: To avoid surprising the accused and to allow them to prepare an adequate defense for a single alleged crime.
- **Exception**: When the law prescribes a single punishment for various offenses, such as in **complex crimes** (e.g., when one offense is a necessary means for committing the other).

---

## 4. CRIMINAL JURISDICTION (Rule 110)

- **Territorial Jurisdiction**: The court of the municipality or territory where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients occurred has jurisdiction.
- **Jurisdiction over the Subject Matter**: Determined by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action. It is conferred by law and cannot be waived.
    - **Municipal Trial Courts (MTC)**: Have exclusive original jurisdiction over offenses punishable with imprisonment not exceeding **6 years**.
    - **Regional Trial Courts (RTC)**: Have exclusive original jurisdiction over offenses punishable with imprisonment **exceeding 6 years**.
- **Sandiganbayan Jurisdiction**: Has exclusive original jurisdiction over criminal cases involving high-ranking public officials in relation to their office.

## 5. VENUE IN CRIMINAL CASES

- **General Rule**: The criminal action shall be instituted and tried in the court of the municipality or territory where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients occurred.
- **Exceptions**:
    1.  Offenses under **Article 157 (Failure to deliver prisoners)** of the Revised Penal Code.
    2.  Cases where the Supreme Court orders a change of venue to avoid a miscarriage of justice.
    3.  **Libel and Written Defamation**: The action may be instituted in the Regional Trial Court of the province or city where the libelous article was printed and first published, or where any of the offended parties actually resided at the time of the commission of the offense.

---

## 6. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION (Rule 112)

### A. DEFINITION AND PURPOSE

- **Definition**: An inquiry or proceeding to determine whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial.
- **Purpose**: To secure the innocent against hasty, malicious, and oppressive prosecution and to protect them from an open and public accusation of crime, from the trouble, expense, and anxiety of a public trial.

### B. WHO MAY CONDUCT

1.  Provincial or City Prosecutors and their assistants.
2.  Judges of the Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (in very limited cases where prosecutors are unavailable).
3.  The Ombudsman and his deputies for cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan.
4.  Other officers as may be authorized by law.

### C. WHEN REQUIRED

- A preliminary investigation is required to be conducted before the filing of a complaint or information for an offense where the penalty prescribed by law is at least **4 years, 2 months, and 1 day** of imprisonment, without regard to the fine.

### D. PROCEDURE

1.  **Filing of Complaint**: The offended party, peace officer, or public officer files a complaint with the investigating prosecutor, accompanied by affidavits of witnesses.
2.  **Issuance of Subpoena**: If the prosecutor finds sufficient ground, they will issue a subpoena to the respondent, attaching the complaint and affidavits.
3.  **Counter-Affidavit**: The respondent submits a counter-affidavit and affidavits of their witnesses within ten (10) days from receipt of the subpoena.
4.  **Resolution**: The prosecutor determines if there is probable cause. If there is, they prepare an information to be filed in court. If not, they recommend the dismissal of the complaint.

### E. INQUEST PROCEDURE

- **When Conducted**: An inquest is an informal and summary investigation conducted by a public prosecutor in criminal cases involving persons arrested and detained **without the benefit of a warrant of arrest**.
- **Purpose**: To determine whether or not the person detained should remain under custody and be charged in court.
- **Rights of Detained Person**: The person under inquest has the right to request a preliminary investigation. However, they must sign a waiver of the provisions of **Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code** (Delay in the delivery of detained persons).

---

## 7. PROSECUTION OF CIVIL ACTION (Rule 111)

- **General Rule**: When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action.
- **This means**: The same criminal case will also determine the civil liability of the accused (e.g., the amount of damages to be paid to the victim).
- **Exception**: The offended party may waive the civil action, reserve the right to institute it separately, or institute the civil action prior to the criminal action.

3.  **c) The prosecutor.** Rule 110, Sec. 4, states that an information is subscribed by the prosecutor.
4.  **c) Preliminary Investigation.** Rule 112 requires a preliminary investigation for offenses where the penalty is at least 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day. Ten years is above this threshold.

9.  **b) To determine if there is probable cause to hold the accused for trial.** This protects the innocent from the burdens of a full-blown trial.
10. **b) When a person is arrested without a warrant.** The inquest is a summary procedure to determine the legality of the arrest and if there is a basis to file a charge.

12. **b) The suspect is brought to a prosecutor for inquest.** This applies to valid warrantless arrests.
