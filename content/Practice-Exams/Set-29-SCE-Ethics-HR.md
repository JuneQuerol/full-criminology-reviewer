title: 'Practice Exam: Sociology of Crimes & Ethics - Ethics & Human Relations (Set 29)'
description: 'A 30-question practice exam covering professional ethics, human relations in criminal justice, and victimology.'
---

### 1. Which of the following best defines ethics?

- [ ] A set of laws that govern the behavior of a particular group.
- [x] A branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct.
- [ ] The customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group.
- [ ] The legal precedents that dictate professional responsibilities.

> Explanation: Ethics is a branch of philosophy concerned with moral principles and values. It provides a framework for determining what is right and wrong, going beyond what is strictly legal or customary.

### 2. The PNP Code of Professional Conduct and Ethical Standards is primarily based on which of the following?

- [ ] The Revised Penal Code
- [x] Republic Act No. 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees
- [ ] The National Internal Security Policy
- [ ] The PNP's historical traditions

> Explanation: R.A. 6713 provides the foundational ethical framework for all government employees in the Philippines, including the Philippine National Police. The PNP's own code is an implementation and extension of this law.

### 3. An officer who accepts a small gift from a citizen as a token of gratitude, without any expectation of future favors, is engaging in what is known as:

- [ ] Extortion
- [x] Grass-eating
- [ ] Meat-eating
- [ ] Bribery

> Explanation: "Grass-eating" is a term for minor, opportunistic corruption where officers accept small gratuities. This is distinct from "meat-eating," which involves more aggressive and premeditated forms of corruption. Bribery involves a clear `quid pro quo`, and extortion is obtaining something through threats.

### 4. What is the core principle of human relations in policing?

- [ ] Establishing a strict, authoritarian presence to deter crime.
- [x] Building a positive and cooperative relationship between the police and the community.
- [ ] Focusing exclusively on law enforcement and arrest statistics.
- [ ] Prioritizing the needs of the police force over the community.

> Explanation: Effective human relations in policing, often called community policing, emphasizes partnership and mutual respect between officers and the public to prevent crime and solve community problems collaboratively.

### 5. What is victimology?

- [ ] The study of criminal behavior.
- [ ] The study of law enforcement techniques.
- [x] The scientific study of victimization, including the relationships between victims and offenders, and the interactions between victims and the criminal justice system.
- [ ] The study of penal systems and correctional institutions.

> Explanation: Victimology is a subfield of criminology that focuses on the victim's experience of crime, the factors that lead to victimization, and the consequences of being a victim.

### 6. According to Victim Precipitation Theory, which of the following best describes 'active precipitation'?

- [ ] The victim was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
- [x] The victim's actions, such as provoking or attacking the offender first, directly led to their victimization.
- [ ] The victim possessed a personal characteristic that made them an attractive target.
- [ ] The victim unknowingly placed themselves in a dangerous situation.

> Explanation: Active precipitation occurs when the victim's behavior directly instigates the criminal event. For example, initiating a physical altercation and then becoming the victim of an assault.

### 7. Which theory suggests that an individual's daily activities and behaviors, such as going to bars late at night or associating with criminals, increase their risk of victimization?

- [ ] Routine Activities Theory
- [x] Lifestyle Theory
- [ ] Deviant Place Theory
- [ ] Victim Precipitation Theory

> Explanation: Lifestyle Theory posits that certain lifestyles and behavioral patterns expose individuals to a higher risk of becoming victims of crime. It's about who you are and what you do, rather than just where you go.

### 8. Routine Activities Theory requires the convergence of which three elements for a crime to occur?

- [ ] Poverty, unemployment, and lack of education.
- [x] A motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian.
- [ ] A weapon, an opportunity, and a getaway plan.
- [ ] A victim, an offender, and a witness.

> Explanation: This theory states that crime is likely to occur when these three elements converge in time and space: someone motivated to commit a crime, a target (person or property) that is vulnerable, and no one present (like a police officer, security guard, or even a watchful neighbor) to prevent it.

### 9. Which law in the Philippines provides a comprehensive framework for protecting the rights of victims of violent crimes?

- [ ] R.A. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act)
- [x] R.A. 9344 as amended by R.A. 10630 (Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act)
- [ ] R.A. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse)
- [ ] R.A. 6981 (Witness Protection, Security and Benefit Act)

> Explanation: While other laws protect specific victim groups, R.A. 6981 establishes a program to protect witnesses and victims in criminal cases, providing benefits and ensuring their security. It has a broad application for victims assisting in the prosecution of crimes.

### 10. A prosecutor who, despite having strong evidence, decides not to pursue a case because of the defendant's political connections is violating which ethical principle?

- [ ] Confidentiality
- [ ] Loyalty
- [x] Impartiality
- [ ] Diligence

> Explanation: The ethical duty of impartiality requires prosecutors to make decisions based on the merits of the case and the evidence, not on the social status, influence, or identity of the parties involved.

### 11. What does the principle of 'Non-maleficence' in professional ethics mean?

- [ ] To do good.
- [x] To do no harm.
- [ ] To be fair.
- [ ] To be truthful.

> Explanation: The principle of non-maleficence, a cornerstone of medical and professional ethics, obligates professionals to not inflict harm intentionally or unintentionally on their clients or the public.

### 12. A police officer who fabricates evidence to ensure the conviction of a known criminal he believes is guilty is an example of:

- [ ] The "Slippery Slope" phenomenon.
- [x] "Noble Cause" corruption.
- [ ] "Blue-coat" crime.
- [ ] Cooping.

> Explanation: "Noble Cause" corruption occurs when an officer bends or breaks the rules to achieve what they perceive as a "good" outcome (e.g., convicting a guilty person). They justify their unethical actions by their "noble" end goal.

### 13. Which of the following is NOT a core component of the PNP's doctrine on police-community relations?

- [ ] Community Partnership
- [ ] Problem Solving
- [x] Absolute Enforcement of all laws at all times
- [ ] Organizational Transformation

> Explanation: Modern police-community relations emphasize a partnership approach, collaborative problem-solving, and internal changes to support these goals. Absolute enforcement without discretion or community input is contrary to the philosophy of building trust and cooperation.

### 14. An elderly person who is scammed out of their life savings is considered a victim according to which typology?

- [x] Ideal Victim
- [ ] Provocative Victim
- [ ] Participating Victim
- [ ] Unrelated Victim

> Explanation: The concept of the "ideal victim" (coined by Nils Christie) refers to a person who is seen as weak, blameless, and worthy of sympathy when victimized, such as the elderly or children. They are seen as completely innocent and undeserving of their fate.

### 15. A prison guard who smuggles a cell phone to an inmate in exchange for money is committing an act of:

- [ ] Misfeasance
- [ ] Nonfeasance
- [x] Malfeasance
- [ ] Discretion

> Explanation: Malfeasance is the commission of an act that is unequivocally illegal or wrongful, especially by a public official. Smuggling contraband into a prison is a clear example of this. Misfeasance is performing a legal act improperly, and nonfeasance is the failure to act where there was a duty to act.

### 16. What is the main purpose of a professional Code of Conduct for law enforcement?

- [ ] To protect officers from legal liability.
- [ ] To increase the number of arrests.
- [x] To guide officers in their duties, ensure public trust, and provide a basis for discipline.
- [ ] To create a sense of brotherhood among officers.

> Explanation: A Code of Conduct serves as a public declaration of the principles and values of the profession, guiding officers to act ethically and providing a standard against which their behavior can be measured, thereby fostering public confidence.

### 17. The concept that victimization is a result of the victim's high-risk behaviors and choices, such as associating with criminals or frequenting dangerous places, is central to:

- [x] Lifestyle Theory
- [ ] Victim Precipitation Theory
- [ ] Routine Activities Theory
- [ ] Subculture of Violence Theory

> Explanation: Lifestyle Theory directly links the probability of victimization to the victim's lifestyle choices and behavioral patterns. High-risk lifestyles (e.g., criminal activity, drug use) inherently increase exposure to offenders.

### 18. A woman is walking home alone at night through a poorly lit alley known for frequent muggings. A man jumps out and robs her. Which theory best explains this scenario?

- [ ] Victim Precipitation Theory
- [x] Routine Activities Theory
- [ ] Lifestyle Theory
- [ ] Deviant Place Theory

> Explanation: This is a classic example of Routine Activities Theory. There is a motivated offender (the mugger), a suitable target (the woman), and the absence of a capable guardian (no police, no witnesses in the dark alley).

### 19. The Victim and Witness Protection Program (R.A. 6981) offers all of the following EXCEPT:

- [ ] Security protection for the witness and their family.
- [ ] Financial assistance for transportation and subsistence.
- [x] Automatic acquittal or pardon for any pending criminal cases of the witness.
- [ ] Relocation and change of personal identity.

> Explanation: While the program offers extensive protection and benefits, it does not automatically grant acquittal or pardon for the witness's own criminal liabilities. The witness may apply for pardon or parole, but it is not an automatic benefit.

### 20. An officer who, during an interrogation, lies to a suspect by saying their accomplice has already confessed is using a form of:

- [ ] Coercion
- [x] Deception
- [ ] Physical abuse
- [ ] Bribery

> Explanation: This is a common and generally legally permissible interrogation tactic known as deception. It involves using trickery or misrepresentation to elicit a confession. It is distinct from coercion, which involves threats of harm or promises of leniency that are not allowed.

### 21. What is the ethical principle that obligates a professional to be faithful to their duties and responsibilities?

- [ ] Justice
- [x] Fidelity
- [ ] Beneficence
- [ ] Autonomy

> Explanation: Fidelity refers to the duty to be loyal, keep promises, and honor one's commitments. For a police officer, this means being faithful to their oath, their agency, and their public service responsibilities.

### 22. Which of the following is the best example of 'passive precipitation' in victimology?

- [ ] A person starts a bar fight and gets seriously injured.
- [x] A member of one rival gang is assaulted by another simply because of their affiliation.
- [ ] A person leaves their car unlocked with valuables in plain sight.
- [ ] A person argues with an armed robber and is shot.

> Explanation: Passive precipitation occurs when a victim possesses a characteristic or belongs to a group that unknowingly threatens or provokes an offender. The victim's mere identity, not their direct action, is what incites the attack.

### 23. A police department that focuses on building relationships, holding community meetings, and using foot patrols to increase visibility and trust is practicing:

- [ ] Traditional Policing
- [ ] Reactive Policing
- [x] Community-Oriented Policing
- [ ] Zero-Tolerance Policing

> Explanation: Community-Oriented Policing (COP) is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies to address the causes of crime and reduce fear by fostering a close working relationship between the police and the community.

### 24. A correctional officer's duty to provide inmates with basic humane treatment, including adequate food, shelter, and medical care, is an ethical obligation rooted in:

- [ ] The principle of retribution.
- [x] The respect for human dignity and rights.
- [ ] The need for institutional security.
- [ ] The officer's contractual employment.

> Explanation: Even though individuals are incarcerated, they retain basic human rights. Ethical corrections practice is founded on the principle that all individuals, including inmates, possess inherent dignity that must be respected.

### 25. Which ethical theory suggests that the morality of an action is determined by its adherence to a set of rules or duties?

- [ ] Utilitarianism
- [x] Deontology
- [ ] Virtue Ethics
- [ ] Consequentialism

> Explanation: Deontology, most famously associated with Immanuel Kant, posits that actions are morally right or wrong based on whether they follow a set of clear moral rules or duties (e.g., "Do not lie"), regardless of the consequences.

### 26. The phenomenon where officers are more likely to cover up for a fellow officer's misconduct than to report it is known as:

- [ ] The "Slippery Slope"
- [x] The "Blue Wall of Silence"
- [ ] The "Noble Cause"
- [ ] The "Rotten Apple" theory

> Explanation: The "Blue Wall of Silence" or "Blue Code" is the informal code of silence among police officers where they refuse to report on a colleague's errors, misconducts, or crimes to protect them.

### 27. The theory that crime and victimization are higher in places where there is a breakdown of social control and physical decay is known as:

- [ ] Lifestyle Theory
- [ ] Routine Activities Theory
- [x] Deviant Place Theory
- [ ] Subculture of Violence Theory

> Explanation: Deviant Place Theory argues that victimization is primarily a function of where one lives. It's the exposure to dangerous places, not just personal lifestyle choices, that increases risk. These places are characterized by poverty, density, and disorganization.

### 28. Which of the following is a right guaranteed to a victim under Philippine law?

- [ ] The right to demand a specific sentence for the offender.
- [x] The right to be present and heard during certain stages of the criminal proceedings.
- [ ] The right to personally interrogate the accused in court.
- [ ] The right to veto a plea bargaining agreement.

> Explanation: Victims have the right to participate in the process, often through a private prosecutor or by providing a victim impact statement. While they cannot dictate the outcome, their voice and presence are legally recognized.

### 29. A judge who consistently gives harsher sentences to defendants from a specific ethnic minority, despite similar case facts, is violating the ethical principle of:

- [ ] Confidentiality
- [ ] Diligence
- [x] Justice and Fairness
- [ ] Competence

> Explanation: Justice and fairness demand that judicial decisions be made impartially, without bias or prejudice based on factors like race, ethnicity, or religion. The judge's actions demonstrate a clear bias, undermining the core of judicial ethics.

### 30. Police-community relations (PCR) is a two-way street. What does this mean?

- [ ] Police give orders, and the community must obey.
- [x] It requires mutual trust, respect, and cooperation from both the police and the community to be effective.
- [ ] Only the police are responsible for improving the relationship.
- [ ] The community must fund all PCR programs.

> Explanation: The "two-way street" analogy highlights the shared responsibility in fostering good police-community relations. Both the police and the community must be willing to communicate, cooperate, and work together to achieve public safety.
