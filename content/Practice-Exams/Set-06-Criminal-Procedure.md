# Answer Key & Explanations

1.  **D. All of the above.**
    *   **Explanation:** Rule 113, Section 5 of the Rules of Court enumerates the instances of lawful warrantless arrests, which include "in flagrante delicto" (a), "hot pursuit" (b), and arrest of an escapee (c).

2.  **B. To inform the person of the cause of the arrest and the fact that a warrant has been issued for his arrest.**
    *   **Explanation:** Rule 113, Section 7 states that the officer need not have the warrant in his possession at the time of the arrest, but after the arrest, if the person so requires, the warrant shall be shown to him as soon as practicable. The primary duty is to inform the arrested person of the cause of the arrest. Delivering the person to the court is a subsequent step.

3.  **C. The right to be released upon posting bail, regardless of the offense.**
    *   **Explanation:** The right to bail is not absolute. It is not available for offenses punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment if the evidence of guilt is strong. The other options are fundamental rights under custodial investigation (Miranda Rights).

4.  **D. Any judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce.**
    *   **Explanation:** The Constitution (Article III, Section 2) requires that a judge personally determines probable cause after examining the complainant and witnesses under oath. This is a judicial function.

5.  **D. All of the above.**
    *   **Explanation:** These are all well-established exceptions to the rule requiring a search warrant. Each has its own set of requirements and limitations.

6.  **B. A doctrine that permits an officer to seize contraband which is in their plain sight, provided the officer is in a place where they have a right to be.**
    *   **Explanation:** The "plain view" doctrine applies when (1) the officer has a prior valid intrusion into a position from which he can view a particular area; (2) the discovery of the evidence in plain view is inadvertent; and (3) it is immediately apparent to the officer that the item he observes may be evidence of a crime, contraband, or otherwise subject to seizure.

7.  **A. The security given for the release of a person in custody of the law, furnished by him or a bondsman, to guarantee his appearance before any court as required.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the definition of bail provided in Rule 114, Section 1 of the Rules of Court. Its purpose is to ensure the accused's presence at trial.

8.  **C. Both A and B.**
    *   **Explanation:** Rule 114, Section 4 of the Rules of Court states that bail is a matter of right before conviction by the MTC, and before conviction by the RTC for offenses not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment.

9.  **A. Upon conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment.**
    *   **Explanation:** Under Rule 114, Section 5, upon conviction by the RTC, bail becomes discretionary. Bail before conviction for a capital offense where evidence is not strong is considered a matter of right, although a hearing is required.

10. **A. The stage where the accused is formally charged in open court and asked to enter a plea.**
    *   **Explanation:** Arraignment is a crucial stage in the criminal process where the accused is formally informed of the charges against him and enters his plea of guilty or not guilty (Rule 116, Section 1).

11. **C. The court shall enter a plea of "not guilty" for the accused.**
    *   **Explanation:** Rule 116, Section 1(c) provides that if the accused refuses to plead or makes a conditional plea, a plea of not guilty shall be entered for him.

12. **B. Plea bargaining.**
    *   **Explanation:** Plea bargaining is the process of negotiating an agreement between the prosecution and the accused for a plea to a lesser offense or a lighter sentence in exchange for a guilty plea (Rule 116, Section 2).

13. **D. All of the above.**
    *   **Explanation:** The pre-trial conference is designed to streamline the trial by having the parties consider plea bargaining, stipulate facts, mark evidence, and address other matters that will promote a fair and expeditious trial (Rule 118, Section 1).

14. **A. An objection by the defense to the prosecution's evidence on the ground that it is insufficient to warrant a conviction.**
    *   **Explanation:** A demurrer to evidence is filed by the accused after the prosecution rests its case, arguing that the evidence presented is insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (Rule 119, Section 23).

15. **C. The case is dismissed, and it amounts to an acquittal.**
    *   **Explanation:** If the court grants the demurrer, the dismissal is on the merits and operates as an acquittal. Therefore, the accused cannot be re-prosecuted for the same offense (double jeopardy).

16. **B. Prosecution, Defense, Rebuttal, Sur-rebuttal.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the standard order of trial under Rule 119, Section 11, ensuring a logical presentation of evidence.

17. **B. Trial in Absentia.**
    *   **Explanation:** Trial in absentia is allowed if the accused has been arraigned, has been duly notified of the trial, and his failure to appear is unjustifiable (Constitution, Article III, Section 14).

18. **B. The adjudication by the court that the accused is guilty or not guilty of the offense charged and the imposition on him of the proper penalty and civil liability, if any.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the comprehensive definition of a judgment in a criminal case as stated in Rule 120, Section 1.

19. **D. All of the above.**
    *   **Explanation:** Rule 120, Section 2 requires that a judgment of conviction must state clearly and distinctly the legal qualification of the offense, the penalty, and the civil liability.

20. **A. By reading it in the presence of the accused and any judge of the court in which it was rendered.**
    *   **Explanation:** Promulgation of judgment is a formal act where the judgment is read to the accused in open court (Rule 120, Section 6).

21. **B. It means the period for appealing the judgment has lapsed, and it becomes immutable and unalterable.**
    *   **Explanation:** A judgment becomes final when the 15-day period to appeal has expired with no appeal being filed, or when the highest court has rendered its decision.

22. **B. The accused is found not guilty based on the evidence presented.**
    *   **Explanation:** An acquittal is a finding of not guilty by the court, which may be based on the insufficiency of evidence or the failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

23. **D. All of the above.**
    *   **Explanation:** A warrant of arrest remains valid until it is fully served (executed), or until it is lifted or recalled by the issuing judge. The case being dismissed would also render the warrant without effect.

24. **A. The person of the arrested individual and the area within his immediate control.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the scope of a search incidental to a lawful arrest, intended to find and seize weapons or evidence that the person might destroy or use.

25. **C. Ensure the appearance of the accused in court when required.**
    *   **Explanation:** The sole purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused, who is presumed innocent, is not imprisoned unnecessarily but can be compelled to appear for trial.

26. **B. At any time before the judgment of conviction becomes final.**
    *   **Explanation:** The court may permit an improvident plea of guilty to be withdrawn and be substituted by a plea of not guilty at any time before the judgment of conviction becomes final (Rule 116, Section 3).

27. **B. The accused admits the act but interposes a lawful defense, so the defense presents its evidence first.**
    *   **Explanation:** In a reverse trial, the burden of proof shifts. The accused must prove their justifying, exempting, or absolving circumstance.

28. **C. The trial is postponed indefinitely without good cause.**
    *   **Explanation:** The right to a speedy trial protects the accused from vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays in the trial process. Unreasonable and unexplained delays violate this right.

29. **A. Double jeopardy.**
    *   **Explanation:** The "finality-of-acquittal" rule stems from the constitutional proscription against double jeopardy, which prevents the state from appealing a judgment of acquittal and putting the accused at risk of being tried for the same offense again.

30. **D. The court where the case is pending.**
    *   **Explanation:** A petition for bail for a capital offense requires a hearing to determine if the evidence of guilt is strong. This hearing must be conducted by the court where the criminal case is pending, as it is the one that will try the case and receive the evidence.
