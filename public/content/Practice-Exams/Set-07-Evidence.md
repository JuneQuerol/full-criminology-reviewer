### Answer Key

1.  **A) A witness testifying that they saw the accused shoot the victim.**
    *   **Explanation:** Direct evidence proves a fact in issue without the need for any inference or presumption. Seeing the act itself is direct evidence. The other options are circumstantial evidence.

2.  **C) Senses in general**
    *   **Explanation:** Rule 130, Section 1 of the Rules of Court states that object (or real) evidence is "addressed to the senses of the court." This is not limited to sight and touch but can include hearing, smell, etc.

3.  **B) Documentary evidence**
    *   **Explanation:** Documentary evidence consists of writings or any material containing letters, words, numbers, figures, symbols, or other modes of written expression offered as proof of their contents. A transcript fits this definition.

4.  **C) Relevant**
    *   **Explanation:** Evidence is relevant if it has a logical connection to the fact in issue. Materiality refers to evidence directed to prove a fact in issue. Competency refers to the admissibility of evidence under the rules.

5.  **C) Incompetent**
    *   **Explanation:** Evidence obtained in violation of the Constitution (e.g., through torture) is incompetent and inadmissible. It is excluded by the rules of evidence.

6.  **A) Tends to prove the same point.**
    *   **Explanation:** Corroborative evidence strengthens or confirms evidence already given by tending to prove the same point, but it comes from a different source or is of a different character.

7.  **A) Their personal knowledge.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the core principle of the Hearsay Rule. A witness must have personally perceived the facts they are testifying about.

8.  **A) Dying declaration**
    *   **Explanation:** A dying declaration (ante-mortem statement) is a well-established exception to the Hearsay Rule, admissible under specific conditions.

9.  **A) Impending and certain death.**
    *   **Explanation:** For a dying declaration to be admissible, the declarant must believe that death is imminent and that there is no hope of recovery.

10. **A) Res gestae**
    *   **Explanation:** The rule of res gestae refers to statements made spontaneously in connection with a startling occurrence. The statement is considered part of the event itself.

11. **B) Entries made in the course of business.**
    *   **Explanation:** The "shop book rule," now referred to as entries in the course of business, allows the admission of business records as an exception to the hearsay rule, provided they were made in the regular course of business.

12. **C) Pecuniary, proprietary, or penal.**
    *   **Explanation:** A declaration against interest can be against the declarant's financial (pecuniary), property (proprietary), or legal (penal) interests.

13. **A) The original document itself.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the essence of the Best Evidence Rule (now called the Original Document Rule). To prove the contents of a document, the original must be presented.

14. **C) Documentary evidence**
    *   **Explanation:** The Best Evidence Rule applies specifically and exclusively when the subject of the inquiry is the contents of a document.

15. **A) When the original is in the custody of the adverse party and they fail to produce it after reasonable notice.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is one of the main grounds for allowing the presentation of secondary evidence. The other options are either incorrect or describe different situations.

16. **B) When the document is used to prove a fact that is only incidental to the main issue.**
    *   **Explanation:** When the contents of a document are not the primary issue but are only collateral to the main point of the case, the Best Evidence Rule does not strictly apply. The rule in option C is the "voluminous records" exception, not the collateral facts rule.

17. **A) An electronic document and equivalent to an original.**
    *   **Explanation:** The Rules on Electronic Evidence provide that a facsimile transmission is an electronic document and is admissible as the functional equivalent of an original, provided its authenticity and integrity can be established.

18. **A) Integration Rule**
    *   **Explanation:** The Parole Evidence Rule, also known as the Integration Rule, prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to vary, contradict, or add to the terms of a written agreement that is "integrated" (complete).

19. **B) Any person, as long as they can perceive and make known their perception to others.**
    *   **Explanation:** Rule 130, Section 20 states that all persons who can perceive, and perceiving, can make known their perception to others, may be witnesses. There is a presumption of competency.

20. **B) Without the consent of the affected spouse.**
    *   **Explanation:** The rule on spousal immunity is not absolute. The affected spouse can waive the privilege and consent to the testimony. There are also exceptions, such as a crime committed by one spouse against the other.

21. **C) A rule that prevents a party from testifying against the estate of a deceased person about any matter of fact occurring before the death.**
    *   **Explanation:** The Dead Man's Statute is designed to protect the estate of the deceased from fraudulent claims by preventing the surviving party to a transaction from testifying on matters that the deceased can no longer rebut.

22. **D) Any advice given or treatment administered by the physician.**
    *   **Explanation:** The physician-patient privilege covers any confidential communication made by the patient to the physician, including any information the physician acquires in a professional capacity that was necessary to enable them to act in that capacity, and any advice given or treatment prescribed. Option B is too narrow, as it does not need to blacken the character.

23. **B) Competency examination (voir dire).**
    *   **Explanation:** The court conducts a voir dire examination to determine if a child witness is competent to testify, assessing their ability to perceive, remember, communicate, and understand the duty to tell the truth.

24. **A) Suggests to the witness the answer which the examining party desires.**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the definition of a leading question. They are generally not allowed on direct examination but are permitted on cross-examination.

25. **B) Establish his or her claim or defense by the amount of evidence required by law.**
    *   **Explanation:** Burden of proof (onus probandi) is the obligation to prove one's assertion.

26. **C) Prosecution**
    *   **Explanation:** In a criminal case, the state (prosecution) has the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden never shifts to the accused.

27. **A) When the evidence for the prosecution and defense are equally balanced, the scale should be tilted in favor of the accused.**
    *   **Explanation:** The equipose rule dictates that if the evidence is in equilibrium, the presumption of innocence prevails, and the accused must be acquitted.

28. **C) Preponderance of evidence**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the standard of proof in civil cases. It means that the evidence as a whole adduced by one side is superior to that of the other.

29. **A) Presumption**
    *   **Explanation:** A presumption is a rule of law that attaches probative value to specific facts or directs that an inference be drawn as to the existence of a fact, not actually known, arising from its usual connection with other particular facts.

30. **B) Disputable presumption**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a species of rebuttable or disputable presumption. It can be overcome by contrary evidence. Conclusive presumptions, on the other hand, cannot be contradicted.
