## 2. LIBEL (Art. 353-362)

### A. DEFINITION OF LIBEL (Art. 353)

Libel is a public and malicious imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to blacken the memory of one who is dead.

-   **Public and Malicious Imputation**: The defamatory statement must be made publicly with malice.
-   **Crime, Vice, Defect**: The imputation can be about a crime, a moral failing (vice), or a physical or psychological defect, whether it's real or not.
-   **Tends to Cause Dishonor, Discredit, Contempt**: The statement must have the potential to damage the reputation of the person it is about.

### B. ELEMENTS OF LIBEL

1.  **Imputation of a Discreditable Act**: The statement must impute a crime, vice, defect, or any act or circumstance that is damaging to the reputation.
2.  **Publication**: The defamatory statement must be communicated to a third person.
3.  **Identity of the Person Defamed**: The person defamed must be identifiable by the statement.
4.  **Existence of Malice**: There must be malice, which is the intent to injure the reputation of the person defamed. Malice is presumed in every defamatory imputation (malice in law), unless privileged communication is proven (malice in fact).

### C. LIBEL BY MEANS OF WRITING (Art. 355)

Libel committed by means of writing, printing, lithography, engraving, radio, phonograph, painting, theatrical exhibition, cinematographic exhibition, or any similar means. This is the most common form of libel, often found in newspapers, magazines, and online articles.

### D. THREATENING TO PUBLISH LIBEL (Art. 356)

This crime is committed by a person who threatens another to publish a libel concerning him or the parents, spouse, child, or other members of the family of the latter, or who shall offer to prevent the publication of such libel for compensation or money consideration.

### E. PROHIBITED PUBLICATION (Art. 357)

This article punishes any person who shall publish or cause to be published, with malice, any news, report, or comment on any private transactions of another, if such publication would offend the dignity, honor, or reputation of the latter.

### F. VENUE OF LIBEL CASES

The criminal action for libel may be filed in the Regional Trial Court of the province or city where:
1.  The libelous article was printed and first published.
2.  The offended party actually resided at the time of the commission of the offense.
3.  If the offended party is a public officer, where he held office at the time of the offense.

## 3. SLANDER (Art. 358)

### A. ORAL DEFAMATION

Slander is oral defamation. It is the speaking of base and defamatory words which tend to prejudice another in his reputation, office, trade, business, or means of livelihood.

-   **Simple Slander**: Defamation that is not of a serious and insulting nature.
-   **Grave Slander**: Defamation that is of a serious and insulting nature, taking into consideration the sense and grammatical meaning of the utterances, the time, place, and manner of the utterance, and the relationship between the accused and the offended party.

### B. SLANDER BY DEED (Art. 359)

**Definition**: Any person who shall perform any act not included in any other crime against honor, which shall cast dishonor, discredit, or contempt upon another person.

**Elements**:
1.  That the offender performs an act.
2.  That the act is performed in the presence of other person or persons.
3.  That such act is not included in any other crime against honor.
4.  That such act casts dishonor, discredit, or contempt upon the offended party.
*Example: Slapping someone in public with the intent to humiliate.*

## 4. INCRIMINATORY MACHINATIONS (Art. 363-364)

### A. INCRIMINATING INNOCENT PERSON (Art. 363)

Any person who, by any act not constituting perjury, shall directly incriminate or impute to an innocent person the commission of a crime. This is commonly known as "planting evidence."

### B. INTRIGUING AGAINST HONOR (Art. 364)

Any person who shall make any intrigue which has for its principal purpose to blemish the honor or reputation of a person. This refers to any scheme or plot designed to dishonor another.

## 5. CYBERLIBEL (RA 10175 - Cybercrime Prevention Act)

-   **Libel Committed Through a Computer System**: Cyberlibel is the commission of libel through a computer system or any other similar means which may be devised in the future.
-   **Penalty One Degree Higher**: The penalty for cyberlibel is one degree higher than that for ordinary libel.
-   **Disini vs. Secretary of Justice**: The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the cyberlibel provisions of RA 10175, but clarified that it only applies to the original author of the defamatory post and not to those who simply "like," "share," or "comment" on it.

---

## 6. DEFENSES IN LIBEL

1.  **Truth**: The truth of the imputation is a defense if it is proven that the matter charged as libelous is true, and that it was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.
2.  **Privileged Communication**:
    *   **Absolute Privileged Communication**: A communication that is not actionable, even if its author is actuated by malice. *Examples: statements made by members of Congress in their official capacity, statements made in judicial proceedings.*
    *   **Qualified Privileged Communication**: A communication that is not actionable unless made with malice. *Examples: a private communication made by any person to another in the performance of any legal, moral, or social duty; a fair and true report, made in good faith, without any comments or remarks, of any judicial, legislative, or other official proceedings.*
3.  **Fair Comment on Matters of Public Interest**: Fair commentaries on matters of public interest are privileged and constitute a valid defense in an action for libel or slander.

## 8. Important Jurisprudence

*   **Daez v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 47971, Oct. 31, 1990)**: For an imputation to be libelous, it must be defamatory, malicious, given publicity, and the victim must be identifiable.
*   **Tulfo v. People (G.R. No. 187113, Jan. 11, 2016)**: The venue for libel is jurisdictional. The complaint must be filed in the place where the libelous article was printed and first published, or where the offended party resided.
*   **Disini v. Secretary of Justice (G.R. No. 203335, Feb. 11, 2014)**: Clarified the scope of cyberlibel, stating that it does not cover those who simply receive or react to the defamatory post.
