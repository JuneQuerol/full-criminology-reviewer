## Answer Key & Explanations

**1. D) All of the above.**
*   **Explanation:** Robbery (Art. 293, RPC) is a complex crime that involves the taking of personal property belonging to another with intent to gain, and the crucial element of using violence against or intimidation of any person, or force upon things.

**2. C) Four.**
*   **Explanation:** Under Art. 306 of the RPC, Highway Robbery/Brigandage is committed by "any person forming a band of robbers for the purpose of committing robbery in the highway, or kidnapping persons for the purpose of extortion or ransom, or for any other purpose to be attained by means of force and violence." It requires at least four armed persons to form a band.

**3. B) Enter the building or break open receptacles where property is kept.**
*   **Explanation:** Robbery with force upon things (Art. 299, RPC) involves the use of force to gain entry into a building or to break open wardrobes, chests, or any other kind of locked or sealed furniture or receptacle where the property is kept.

**4. B) Robbery.**
*   **Explanation:** This is the definition of robbery as provided in Article 293 of the Revised Penal Code.

**5. C) Breaking a window to enter a house.**
*   **Explanation:** This is a classic example of using force upon things to gain entry for the purpose of robbery (Art. 299, RPC). The other options involve violence or intimidation against persons (A, B) or are more characteristic of snatching/theft (D).

**6. C) Violence, intimidation, or force upon things.**
*   **Explanation:** The defining characteristic of robbery that distinguishes it from theft is the employment of violence, intimidation, or force. Both crimes require intent to gain and unlawful taking of property belonging to another.

**7. D) Theft.**
*   **Explanation:** This is the definition of Theft under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code.

**8. B) When the theft is committed by a domestic servant.**
*   **Explanation:** Article 310 of the RPC enumerates the circumstances that qualify the crime of theft, one of which is if it is committed by a domestic servant. While value affects penalty, it doesn't qualify the crime itself. Nighttime is an aggravating circumstance but does not qualify theft on its own.

**9. B) Theft.**
*   **Explanation:** This falls under Art. 308, par. 2(1) of the RPC, which penalizes as theft the act of finding lost property and failing to deliver the same to the local authorities or to its owner.

**10. A) Carnapping.**
*   **Explanation:** The unlawful taking of a motor vehicle is governed by a special law, Republic Act No. 10883, the "New Anti-Carnapping Act of 2016".

**11. C) The taking is done with the owner's consent.**
*   **Explanation:** The very essence of theft is the taking of property *without* the owner's consent. If there is consent, there is no theft.

**12. B) Qualified Theft.**
*   **Explanation:** The theft is qualified because the money was taken with grave abuse of confidence, as the cashier has access to the money by virtue of her position (Art. 310, RPC).

**13. C) By taking property of another without consent.**
*   **Explanation:** This describes theft, not estafa. Estafa involves deceit or abuse of confidence, where the offender gains possession of the property often with the owner's initial (but deceived) consent.

**14. A) Estafa by means of false pretenses.**
*   **Explanation:** This is a form of Estafa under Art. 315, 2(a) of the RPC, which penalizes using a fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions.

**15. D) Both B and C.**
*   **Explanation:** Issuing a check without sufficient funds can give rise to two separate criminal liabilities: Estafa under the RPC if the check was used to defraud someone, and a violation of BP 22, which is a special law that punishes the act of issuing a worthless check itself.

**16. A) The prior possession of the property by the offender.**
*   **Explanation:** In estafa with abuse of confidence (Art. 315, 1(b)), the offender receives the property in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same, but instead misappropriates it.

**17. B) Dolus.**
*   **Explanation:** Dolus is a Latin term for deceit or fraud. Animus lucrandi is intent to gain, and animus furandi is intent to steal. Culpa means fault or negligence.

**18. B) Estafa.**
*   **Explanation:** This is a form of estafa under Art. 316, par. 2 of the RPC, which penalizes any person who, knowing that real property is encumbered, shall dispose of the same, although such encumbrance be not recorded.

**19. B) Arson.**
*   **Explanation:** This is the basic definition of Arson under Presidential Decree No. 1613 (Amending the Law on Arson).

**20. D) A specific form of Arson under Art. 320 of the RPC.**
*   **Explanation:** While this involves fraud (related to Estafa), the law on Arson (PD 1613, which amended Art 320-326 of RPC) specifically penalizes the act of burning one's own property as a means to commit Estafa. This is a special case of Arson.

**21. C) When what is burned is a public building, ammunition factory, or similar structure.**
*   **Explanation:** PD 1613 classifies Arson into two types: Destructive Arson (Section 2) and Other Cases of Arson (Section 3). Destructive Arson involves burning of specific high-risk or public structures.

**22. B) Murder.**
*   **Explanation:** Under the current laws, if death results from Arson, the crime is not a complex crime. The Supreme Court has ruled in several cases (e.g., *People v. Malngan*) that if death is a direct consequence of the burning, the crime is Murder qualified by fire. There is no special complex crime of Arson with Homicide.

**23. B) Arson of property of small value.**
*   **Explanation:** Section 3, paragraph 5 of PD 1613 provides a lesser penalty for the burning of any uninhabited hut, storehouse, barn, shed or any other property, the value of which does not exceed 100 pesos.

**24. A) To cause damage to property through fire.**
*   **Explanation:** The primordial motive and element in arson is the malicious destruction of property by fire. Other intents might be present, but the act itself is centered on burning property.

**25. C) The damage was caused willfully and for the sake of damaging it.**
*   **Explanation:** The key element in Malicious Mischief (Art. 327, RPC) is that the offender deliberately caused damage to the property of another due to a feeling of hatred, revenge, or other evil motive, and not for the purpose of gain.

**26. C) Accidentally breaking a vase while cleaning.**
*   **Explanation:** Malicious Mischief requires intent (dolus). Accidentally causing damage is a result of fault (culpa) and does not constitute malicious mischief.

**27. A) Hatred, revenge, or other evil motive.**
*   **Explanation:** Article 327 requires that the offender who causes damage to the property of another has acted "due to hatred, revenge or other evil motive."

**28. B) Arresto menor or a fine of not less than the value of the damage.**
*   **Explanation:** Article 329 of the RPC provides the penalties for Malicious Mischief. If the value does not exceed 1,000 pesos, the penalty is arresto menor or a fine of not less than the value of the damage and not more than 200 pesos.

**29. A) Disobedience to an Agent of a Person in Authority.**
*   **Explanation:** This would constitute two separate crimes. One is Malicious Mischief for the damage to property, and the other is a crime against public order, likely Resistance and Disobedience to a Person in Authority or the Agents of such Person (Art. 151, RPC).

**30. B) Culpa (Fault/Negligence).**
*   **Explanation:** The crime of Malicious Mischief is an intentional felony. It cannot be committed through negligence or imprudence (culpa). The damage must be caused willfully and deliberately.
