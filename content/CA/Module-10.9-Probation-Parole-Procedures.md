# Module 10.9: Probation & Parole Procedures

## Introduction

**Non-Institutional Corrections**, also known as community-based corrections, refers to the supervision of criminal offenders in the community as an alternative to incarceration. The two main forms of community-based corrections are **Probation** and **Parole**. While both involve supervision within the community, they are distinct processes that occur at different stages of the criminal justice system. This module will define and differentiate between probation and parole, and outline the basic procedures for their application and administration in the Philippines.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define Probation and Parole and differentiate between the two.
- Identify the purpose and benefits of probation.
- Understand the eligibility requirements and application process for probation under PD 968.
- Describe the role of the Parole and Probation Administration (PPA) and the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP).
- Explain the concept of conditions of probation/parole and the consequences of revocation.

## I. Probation

**Definition:** Probation is a disposition under which a defendant, after conviction and sentence, is **released subject to conditions** imposed by the court and to the supervision of a probation officer. It is a **substitute for imprisonment**.

- **Legal Basis:** In the Philippines, the adult probation system is governed by **Presidential Decree No. 968**, the "Probation Law of 1976."
- **Philosophy:** Probation is based on the belief that some offenders can be rehabilitated more effectively in the community than in prison, and that not all offenders pose a danger to society.

### A. Purpose and Benefits of Probation
- **Promotes Rehabilitation:** Allows the offender to remain in the community, maintain family ties, and keep their job, which are all crucial for successful reintegration.
- **Reduces Prison Overcrowding:** It is a key tool for easing the burden on the country's congested jails and prisons.
- **Cost-Effective:** Supervising an offender in the community is significantly cheaper than incarcerating them.
- **Provides Restitution:** Allows the offender to work and pay restitution to the victim of their crime.

### B. The Probation Process under PD 968

1.  **Application:** After an offender has been convicted and sentenced, they may apply for probation. The application must be filed with the trial court **within the period for perfecting an appeal** (usually 15 days).
    - **Crucial Point:** An application for probation is a **waiver of the right to appeal**. An offender cannot appeal their conviction *and* apply for probation at the same time. They must choose one.

2.  **Post-Sentence Investigation:** The court will order the **Parole and Probation Administration (PPA)** to conduct a post-sentence investigation. A probation officer will investigate the offender's character, background, and the circumstances of the crime to determine if they are a suitable candidate for probation. The officer will submit a **Post-Sentence Investigation Report (PSIR)** to the court with a recommendation.

3.  **Grant or Denial:** The court makes the final decision. The court may grant probation if it finds that:
    - The offender is not in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most effectively by commitment to an institution.
    - There is no undue risk that the offender will commit another crime.
    - Probation will not depreciate the seriousness of the offense.

### C. Who is Disqualified from Probation?
PD 968 specifies several categories of offenders who are **disqualified** from being granted probation:
- Those sentenced to a prison term of **more than 6 years**.
- Those convicted of any crime against the national security or the public order.
- Those who have previously been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than one month and one day and/or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos.
- Those who have been once on probation under the provisions of this Decree.
- Those who are already serving sentence at the time the substantive provisions of this Decree became applicable.

**Board Exam Tip:** The "more than 6 years" sentence disqualification is the most important one to remember.

### D. Conditions and Revocation
- If probation is granted, the offender (now called a **"probationer"**) must abide by a set of conditions, which always include reporting regularly to a probation officer and not committing another crime.
- **Revocation:** If the probationer violates the conditions of their probation, the probation officer can recommend that the court **revoke** the probation. If revoked, the court will order the probationer to serve their original prison sentence.

## II. Parole

**Definition:** Parole is the **conditional release of a prisoner** from a correctional institution after they have served the **minimum** of their prison sentence. It is an administrative function, not a judicial one.

- **Parole vs. Probation:**
    - **Probation** is an alternative to imprisonment (the person does not go to prison).
    - **Parole** is a release *from* prison.
    - Probation is granted by a **judge (the court)**.
    - Parole is granted by the **Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP)**.

### A. The Purpose of Parole
- To serve as an incentive for good behavior in prison.
- To provide a period of supervised transition from the highly structured life in prison back into the community.
- To help manage the prison population.

### B. The Parole Process

1.  **Eligibility:** A prisoner becomes eligible for parole consideration once they have served the **minimum** of their indeterminate sentence.
2.  **Review by the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP):** The BPP will review the prisoner's case, considering factors such as:
    - The seriousness of their crime.
    - Their behavior and disciplinary record while in prison.
    - Their progress in rehabilitation programs.
    - A psychiatric and risk assessment.
3.  **Grant or Denial:** The BPP, acting as a quasi-judicial body, decides whether to grant or deny parole. The decision is based on whether the Board believes the prisoner is ready for release and is no longer a danger to society.

### C. Conditions and Revocation
- If parole is granted, the released prisoner (now called a **"parolee"**) is placed under the supervision of a parole officer from the **Parole and Probation Administration (PPA)**.
- The parolee must abide by a strict set of conditions.
- **Revocation:** If the parolee violates the conditions of their parole, the BPP can issue a warrant for their arrest and order them to be returned to prison to serve the remainder of their original sentence.

## Conclusion

Probation and parole are the two cornerstones of community-based corrections in the Philippines. They provide a mechanism for allowing less dangerous offenders to be rehabilitated within the community, which is both more humane and more cost-effective than mass incarceration. Probation offers a second chance to offenders who might otherwise be drawn into the negative culture of prison life. Parole provides a crucial, supervised bridge for prisoners returning to society, increasing their chances of a successful reintegration. Both systems are managed through a careful process of investigation, supervision, and revocation, balancing the goal of offender rehabilitation with the primary need to ensure public safety.
