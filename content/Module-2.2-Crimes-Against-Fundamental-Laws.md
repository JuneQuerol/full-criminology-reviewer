*   **Right to Privacy of Communication and Correspondence:** Also protected by the laws on Violation of Domicile.

## 9. Important Notes and Distinctions

*   In Arbitrary Detention, the offender is a public officer. In Illegal Detention, the offender is a private individual.
*   In Violation of Domicile, the offender can be a public officer. If a private individual enters a dwelling against the owner's will, the crime is Trespass to Dwelling.
*   The 12-18-36 hour rule in Art. 125 is crucial for board exams. Memorize it.
*   Offending Religious Feelings (Art. 133) requires that the act be "notoriously offensive." This is a high standard.
