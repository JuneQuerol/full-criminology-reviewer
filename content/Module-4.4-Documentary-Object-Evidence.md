# Module 4.4: Documentary and Object Evidence

## I. Documentary Evidence

### A. Definition

**Documentary evidence** consists of writings, recordings, photographs, or any material containing letters, words, sounds, numbers, figures, symbols, or their equivalent, offered as proof of their contents. (Rules of Court, Rule 130, Sec. 2)

Key characteristics:
- It is a tangible object.
- It contains information in a written or symbolic form.
- It is presented in court to prove the truth of the information it contains.

### B. Public vs. Private Documents

#### 1. Public Documents

Public documents are:
a. The written official acts, or records of the official acts of the sovereign authority, official bodies and tribunals, and public officers, whether of the Philippines, or of a foreign country.
b. Documents acknowledged before a notary public except last wills and testaments.
c. Public records, kept in the Philippines, of private documents required by law to be entered therein.

**Evidentiary Value:** Public documents are considered self-authenticating and are prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. They do not require further proof of their execution and authenticity.

#### 2. Private Documents

All other writings are **private**.

**Evidentiary Value:** Private documents require proof of their due execution and authenticity before they can be received in evidence.

### C. Authentication of Private Documents

Before a private document is admitted in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved by any of the following means:
1.  By anyone who saw the document executed or written.
2.  By evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker.
3.  By other evidence showing its due execution and authenticity.

### D. Best Evidence Rule (Original Document Rule)

**General Rule:** When the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original document itself.

**Purpose:** To ensure accuracy and prevent the introduction of altered or fabricated evidence.

**Exceptions (Secondary Evidence is Admissible):**
1.  When the original has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, without bad faith on the part of the offeror.
2.  When the original is in the custody or under the control of the party against whom the evidence is offered, and the latter fails to produce it after reasonable notice.
3.  When the original consists of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot be examined in court without great loss of time and the fact sought to be established from them is only the general result of the whole.
4.  When the original is a public record in the custody of a public officer or is recorded in a public office.

## II. Object (Real) Evidence

### A. Definition

**Object evidence** (or real evidence) are those addressed to the senses of the court. When an object is relevant to the fact in issue, it may be exhibited to, examined, or viewed by the court. (Rules of Court, Rule 130, Sec. 1)

Examples:
- The weapon used in a crime (e.g., knife, gun).
- The clothing of a victim.
- Contraband (e.g., illegal drugs).
- Physical injuries on a person's body.
- Photographs and videos, once authenticated.

### B. Chain of Custody

**Chain of custody** is the duly recorded, chronological history of the handling, transfer, and storage of an object of evidence from the time it is seized until it is presented in court.

**Purpose:** To ensure the integrity and identity of the evidence, guaranteeing that the object presented in court is the same object seized from the accused, and that it has not been tampered with or substituted.

**Links in the Chain:**
1.  **Seizure and Marking:** The seizing officer must mark the evidence with their initials, the date, and time of seizure.
2.  **Turnover to Investigating Officer:** The seizing officer turns over the evidence to the investigating officer. A receipt is issued.
3.  **Turnover to the Crime Laboratory:** The investigating officer submits the evidence to the crime laboratory for examination.
4.  **Custody in the Laboratory:** The forensic chemist or examiner takes custody of the evidence.
5.  **Presentation in Court:** The evidence is brought to court and presented as evidence, with all handlers testifying as to their role in its custody.

Failure to prove the chain of custody can lead to the exclusion of the evidence due to doubts about its integrity.
