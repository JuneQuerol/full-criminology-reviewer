## Introduction

**Police field procedures** are the standardized methods and protocols that police officers follow when conducting operations in the field—from making arrests to executing search warrants to responding to emergencies. These procedures ensure that police actions are lawful, effective, and respectful of human rights.

*Sa madaling salita, ang field procedures ay yung "rulebook" ng pulis pag nasa labas sila. Hindi pwedeng basta-basta lang—may tamang proseso para sa bawat action (arrest, search, etc.). Pag hindi mo sinunod, pwedeng ma-dismiss ang case o ikaw pa ang makasuhan.*

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Understand the legal requirements for lawful arrest.
- Explain the rules on search and seizure (warrantless and with warrant).
- Identify the continuum of force and rules on use of force.
- Describe proper procedures for handling evidence.
- Explain the protocols for responding to different types of calls.

**Board Exam Tip:** Field procedures are tested extensively in both LEA and CDI (Crime Detection & Investigation). Memorize the lawful arrest scenarios, the exceptions to the warrant requirement, and the rules on use of force.

## I. Arrest Procedures

### A. Definition of Arrest

**Arrest** is the taking of a person into custody in order that he may be bound to answer for the commission of an offense.

**Legal Basis:**
- **Rule 113, Rules of Court** - Arrest
- **Revised Penal Code, Art. 125** - Delay in the Delivery of Detained Persons (Arbitrary Detention)

*Arrest = Huli. Pero hindi basta huli—dapat may legal basis. Pag walang legal basis, pwedeng kasuhan ng arbitrary detention ang pulis.*

### B. Types of Arrest

#### 1. **Arrest with Warrant**
   - Issued by a judge after finding probable cause.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Name of the accused or description sufficient to identify him.
     - Offense charged.
     - Signature of the judge.
   - **Validity:** Nationwide and continues until arrested or warrant is recalled.

*Ideal scenario: May warrant. Kasi may judge na nag-review, so legal na legal ang arrest. Pero sa realidad, hindi laging may warrant—kaya may "warrantless arrest."*

#### 2. **Warrantless Arrest (Rule 113, Sec. 5)**

A peace officer may arrest without a warrant in the following cases:

**a. In Flagrante Delicto (Caught in the Act)**
   - The person to be arrested is committing, has just committed, or is attempting to commit an offense **in the presence** of the arresting officer.

*Example: Nakita mong may nag-snatch ng bag ngayon lang—pwede mo hulihin immediately. Walang need ng warrant kasi caught in the act.*

**b. Hot Pursuit**
   - An offense has just been committed, and the arresting officer has **probable cause** to believe, based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances, that the person to be arrested committed it.

*Example: May nag-report na may robbery sa 7-11. Lumabas ang suspect at tumakbo. Hinabol mo. Kahit di mo nakita ang actual robbery, pwede mo hulihin dahil "hot pursuit" at may probable cause.*

**c. Escaped Prisoner**
   - The person to be arrested is a prisoner who escaped from a penal establishment or a detention facility.

**Board Exam Tip:** Memorize the three scenarios of warrantless arrest. Questions often test whether an arrest was lawful or not. If it doesn't fall under these three, it's illegal arrest = arbitrary detention.

### C. Procedure During Arrest

**1. Identification**
   - Identify yourself as a police officer.
   - Show your ID or badge.

**2. Inform the Person**
   - "You are under arrest."
   - State the reason for the arrest (offense committed).

**3. Miranda Rights (Custodial Investigation Rule)**
   - **Right to remain silent.**
   - **Any statement may be used against you.**
   - **Right to competent and independent counsel.**
   - If cannot afford, the State will provide.

*Tip: Yung "You have the right to remain silent..."—yan yung Miranda Rights na laging maririnig mo sa mga pelikula. Required yan bago mag-interrogation. Pag di mo binigay, inadmissible ang confession.*

**4. Use of Reasonable Force**
   - Use only the force necessary to effect the arrest.
   - Excessive force = assault.

**5. Search Incident to Lawful Arrest**
   - After a lawful arrest, you may search the person and the area within his immediate control.
   - Purpose: Officer safety and preservation of evidence.

*Example: Hinarang mo ang suspect. Arrest mo siya for drugs. Pwede mo siyang i-search immediately (pockets, bag) para makita kung may weapon o ebidensya. Yan ang "search incident to lawful arrest."*

**6. Turnover to Proper Authorities**
   - Deliver the arrested person to the nearest police station or jail.
   - **Within 12-18-36 hours** (depending on offense), file the complaint or release the person.

**Art. 125, RPC:** Failure to deliver a detained person to judicial authorities within the prescribed period = **Arbitrary Detention**.

---

## II. Search and Seizure

### A. General Rule: Search Warrant Required

Under the **1987 Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 2**, no search or seizure may be conducted without a valid search warrant issued by a judge.

**Requirements for a Valid Search Warrant:**
1. **Probable cause** determined by the judge.
2. **Particularly describes** the place to be searched and the things to be seized.
3. Based on the **personal examination under oath** of the complainant and witnesses.

*Bakit kailangan ng warrant? Para protektahan ang privacy mo. Hindi pwedeng basta-basta na lang pumasok ang pulis sa bahay mo. Kailangan may judge na nag-approve.*

### B. Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement (Warrantless Search)

Despite the general rule, there are **10 recognized exceptions** where search without a warrant is valid:

#### 1. **Search Incident to Lawful Arrest**
   - After a lawful arrest, the officer may search the person and the area within his immediate control.

#### 2. **Consented Search (Waiver)**
   - The person voluntarily consents to the search.
   - **Must be voluntary, not coerced.**

*Example: "Sir, pwede ko ba tingnan ang bag mo?" "Oo, sige." Yan ay consented search. Pero pag may baril ka sa ulo niya habang nagtanong, hindi yan voluntary—coerced yan.*

#### 3. **Stop and Frisk (Terry Search)**
   - Based on reasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous.
   - Limited to a pat-down of outer clothing.

*Example: May lalaking naglalakad ng suspicious, at may bulge sa tagiliran. Pwede mo siyang i-stop and frisk para sa officer safety.*

#### 4. **Customs Search**
   - At international borders, airports, and seaports.
   - Valid without warrant due to the State's regulatory interest.

#### 5. **Search of Moving Vehicles**
   - Due to their mobility, vehicles may be searched at checkpoints if there's probable cause.

*Example: May checkpoint. May naamoy kang marijuana sa kotse. Pwede mo i-search ang vehicle without warrant.*

#### 6. **Plain View Doctrine**
   - If an officer is lawfully in a position to view an object, and it is immediately apparent that the object is evidence, he may seize it.

*Example: Pumunta ka sa bahay dahil may noise complaint. Habang kausap mo ang homeowner sa pintuan, nakita mo sa sala ang baril at drugs sa mesa. Pwede mo kunin yan—plain view.*

#### 7. **Exigent Circumstances**
   - Emergency situations where there is no time to secure a warrant (e.g., hot pursuit, destruction of evidence).

#### 8. **Administrative Search**
   - Inspections by regulatory agencies (e.g., fire marshal, health inspector).

#### 9. **Search in Prisons and Jails**
   - Prisoners have reduced expectation of privacy.

#### 10. **Search of Prohibited Articles in Transit**
   - Prohibited items being transported (e.g., drugs, contraband).

**Board Exam Tip:** Memorize the 10 exceptions. Questions often test whether a warrantless search was valid. If it doesn't fall under these exceptions, it's illegal search = evidence is inadmissible (fruit of the poisonous tree).

## III. Use of Force Continuum

### A. Principles of Use of Force

**Use of force** by police must be:
1. **Lawful** - Authorized by law.
2. **Necessary** - No other means available.
3. **Proportionate** - The level of force used is proportional to the threat.

*Sa madaling salita: Hindi pwedeng barilin ang tao dahil nag-jaywalking siya. Ang force na gagamitin mo ay dapat katumbas lang ng level ng threat. Over-kill = excessive force = criminal liability.*

### B. The Use of Force Continuum

This is a guideline showing the progression of force options available to an officer:

**Level 1: Officer Presence**
   - Mere presence in uniform.
   - Deterrent effect.

**Level 2: Verbalization**
   - Verbal commands ("Stop! Police!").
   - Calm persuasion.

**Level 3: Empty-Hand Control**
   - **Soft techniques**: Grabbing, holding.
   - **Hard techniques**: Punching, kicking.

**Level 4: Less-Lethal Methods**
   - Pepper spray, taser, baton.

**Level 5: Lethal Force**
   - Use of firearm or deadly weapon.
   - **Only when there is imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm** to the officer or others.

*Example: Suspect ay unarmed at tumatakbo lang. Hindi mo pwedeng barilin yan—hindi imminent threat. Pero pag may baril siya at nakatutok na sa iyo o sa civilians, doon justified ang lethal force.*

**Board Exam Tip:** Remember the phrase "**necessary, reasonable, and proportionate**" when discussing use of force.

## IV. Handling and Custody of Evidence

### A. Chain of Custody

**Chain of Custody** is the chronological documentation of the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence.

**Purpose:**
- Ensure the integrity of evidence.
- Prove that the evidence presented in court is the same evidence seized.

**Steps:**
1. **Marking** - At the scene, mark the evidence with initials, date, and time.
2. **Inventory** - List all items seized.
3. **Photographing** - Document the evidence visually.
4. **Packaging** - Place in sealed, tamper-proof containers.
5. **Turnover** - Transfer to evidence custodian with proper documentation.

*Example: May nakuha kang shabu. I-mark mo ng "Exhibit A - 12/11/2025 - PO1 Cruz." Lagay mo sa sealed bag. Picture mo. Tapos i-turnover mo sa evidence custodian with receipt. Lahat ng movements ay documented—yan ang chain of custody.*

**Board Exam Tip:** Breaks in the chain of custody can result in the inadmissibility of evidence. In drug cases, strict compliance with RA 9165 (chain of custody rules) is required.

## V. Response to Calls for Service

### A. Types of Calls

1. **Emergency Calls (Code 1)**
   - Life-threatening situations (shooting, robbery in progress).
   - **Lights and sirens, maximum speed.**

2. **Urgent Calls (Code 2)**
   - Serious but not immediately life-threatening (assault report, suspicious person).
   - **Expedited response, but no lights/sirens unless necessary.**

3. **Routine Calls (Code 3)**
   - Non-emergency (noise complaint, minor accident).
   - **Normal response.**

*Tip: Yung Code 1, 2, 3 ay standard sa radio communications. Code 1 = emergency, kaya naka-full siren ka. Code 3 = chill lang, walang rush.*

### B. Standard Response Procedure

1. **Acknowledge the Call**
   - Confirm receipt via radio ("10-4" or "Copy").

2. **Assess the Situation En Route**
   - Gather information (location, number of suspects, weapons involved).

3. **Approach with Caution**
   - Park a safe distance away.
   - Observe before approaching.

4. **Secure the Scene**
   - Ensure safety of victims, bystanders, and officers.

5. **Render Assistance**
   - Provide medical aid if needed.

6. **Investigate**
   - Interview witnesses, gather evidence.

7. **Make a Report**
   - Document the incident in a police report.

## VI. Checkpoint and Roadblock Operations

### A. Legal Basis

**Checkpoints** are authorized by law to promote public safety and prevent crime (e.g., DUI checkpoints, anti-drug checkpoints).

**Constitutional Requirement:**
- Must be conducted according to **genuine checkpoints**, not as a pretext for illegal search.

**Guidelines (PNP Operational Procedures):**
1. **Authorization** - Must be authorized by a commander.
2. **Public Notice** - Signage and advance warning.
3. **Random Selection** - Not discriminatory.
4. **Minimal Intrusion** - Brief stop only.
5. **Respectful Conduct** - Courtesy at all times.

*Checkpoint rules: Dapat may signage, hindi pwedeng basta hinto lang. At hindi pwedeng puro mukhang pulubi lang ang hihintuin mo—discrimination yan. Random dapat.*

### B. Search at Checkpoints

**General Rule:** No search of vehicles unless there is **probable cause** (e.g., smell of drugs, visible weapon).

**Exception:** Consented search ("Sir, pwede ko po bang tingnan ang trunk?" "Sige.").

---

## VII. Operational Safety Protocols

### A. Officer Safety First

**Rule:** No mission is worth your life. Always prioritize officer safety.

**Tactics:**
1. **Cover and Concealment**
   - Cover = Stops bullets (wall, car engine).
   - Concealment = Hides you but doesn't stop bullets (bushes, car door).

2. **Tactical Positioning**
   - Never stand directly in front of a door.
   - Approach vehicles from the rear at an angle.

3. **Communication**
   - Maintain radio contact.
   - Use backup when needed.

4. **Situational Awareness**
   - Scan your environment constantly.
   - Identify threats and escape routes.

*Tip: Laging mag-call for backup pag risky ang situation. Ang tapang na walang utak ay kamatayan. "Better to be judged by twelve than carried by six."*

## Conclusion & Key Takeaways

Police field procedures are not just bureaucratic red tape—they are safeguards that protect both the public and the police. A lawful arrest, a valid search, a justified use of force—these ensure that justice is served while respecting human rights. On the streets, split-second decisions are made, but those decisions must be grounded in training, law, and ethics.

**Key Concepts to Remember:**
- **Warrantless Arrest**: In flagrante delicto, hot pursuit, escaped prisoner.
- **Warrantless Search**: 10 exceptions (search incident to arrest, consented, stop & frisk, plain view, etc.).
- **Use of Force**: Necessary, reasonable, proportionate.
- **Chain of Custody**: Mark, inventory, photograph, package, turnover.
- **Checkpoint**: Authorized, public notice, random, minimal intrusion.

*Final Tip para sa board exam: Pag may tanong tungkol sa field procedures, i-emphasize ang "lawfulness" at "constitutional rights." Kahit gaano ka ka-sure na guilty ang suspect, pag illegal ang procedure mo, wala ding silbi—ma-dismiss ang case. Kaya sundin ang tamang proseso.*

**Board Exam Tip:** Expect scenario-based questions. Example: "An officer saw a man running from a store where an alarm was ringing. Can the officer arrest without a warrant?" Answer: Yes, hot pursuit (warrantless arrest).
