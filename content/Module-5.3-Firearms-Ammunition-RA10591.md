          {
            "question": "What are the four main components of a modern cartridge?",
            "options": ["Bullet, Casing, Propellant, Primer", "Barrel, Stock, Trigger, Sight", "Shell, Fuse, Explosive, Fin", "Warhead, Guidance system, Rocket motor, Airframe"],
            "answer": "Bullet, Casing, Propellant, Primer",
            "explanation": "A modern cartridge consists of four key components: the bullet (the projectile), the casing (which holds all parts together), the propellant (gunpowder that provides the energy), and the primer (which ignites the propellant when struck by the firing pin)."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is the purpose of rifling in a firearm's barrel?",
            "options": ["To increase the speed of the bullet", "To impart spin on the bullet for accuracy and stability", "To reduce the noise of the gunshot", "To cool the barrel down"],
            "answer": "To impart spin on the bullet for accuracy and stability",
            "explanation": "Rifling consists of spiral grooves inside the barrel that grip the bullet as it passes through, causing it to spin. This gyroscopic stability prevents the bullet from tumbling and increases its accuracy over distance."

            "question": "Which of the following is classified as a 'high explosive'?",
            "options": ["Black powder", "Smokeless powder", "Dynamite", "Pyrotechnic flash powder"],
            "answer": "Dynamite",
            "explanation": "High explosives, such as dynamite, are characterized by a very high rate of reaction, or detonation. Low explosives, like black powder and smokeless powder, undergo a slower reaction called deflagration (rapid burning)."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is the primary difference between detonation and deflagration?",
            "options": ["Detonation is silent, while deflagration is loud.", "Detonation is a subsonic reaction, while deflagration is a supersonic reaction.", "Detonation is a supersonic reaction wave, while deflagration is a subsonic combustion process.", "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable."],
            "answer": "Detonation is a supersonic reaction wave, while deflagration is a subsonic combustion process.",
            "explanation": "The key distinction is the speed of the reaction front. In detonation, the shock wave moves faster than the speed of sound in the material, creating a powerful shattering effect. In deflagration, the reaction moves slower than the speed of sound, producing a pushing or heaving effect."
