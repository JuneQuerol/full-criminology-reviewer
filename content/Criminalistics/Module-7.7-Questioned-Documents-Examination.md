# Module 7.7: Questioned Documents Examination

## Introduction

A questioned document is any signature, handwriting, typewriting, or other mark whose source or authenticity is in dispute or doubtful. The field of **Questioned Documents Examination (QDE)** is the forensic science discipline that involves the scientific analysis of these documents. A Questioned Document Examiner (QDE) is the expert who determines the authenticity, origin, and authorship of documents, and can detect alterations, additions, or deletions. This module covers the scope of QDE, the distinction between questioned and standard documents, and the types of examinations performed.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define "Questioned Document" and "Standard Document."
- Identify the various classes and types of questioned documents.
- Understand the qualifications and role of a Questioned Document Examiner.
- Describe the scientific instruments used in document examination.
- List the common signs of forgery.

## I. Scope of Questioned Documents Examination

The work of a QDE goes far beyond simply comparing signatures. The field covers a wide range of issues related to the production and authenticity of documents.

**Common Questions Addressed by a QDE:**
- Is the signature on the document genuine? (Forgery)
- Was this document written by the same person who wrote another document? (Authorship)
- Have any words or numbers on the document been altered, added, or erased? (Alterations)
- Is the document a counterfeit? (e.g., currency, passport)
- What is the source of the paper or ink?
- Was this document typed on a specific typewriter or printed by a specific printer?

**Classes of Questioned Documents:**
1.  Documents with questioned signatures.
2.  Documents containing alleged fraudulent alterations.
3.  Holograph documents (documents that are entirely handwritten by one person).
4.  Documents questioned on the basis of their age or date.
5.  Documents questioned on the basis of the materials used in their production.
6.  Documents involving typewriting or other mechanical impressions.

## II. Standards (Exemplars) for Comparison

To determine the authenticity or source of a questioned document, the examiner needs a sufficient number of **known authentic samples**, called **standards** or **exemplars**, to compare it with.

### Types of Standards

1.  **Collected/Procured Standards:** These are handwriting or signature samples that were written by the subject in the normal course of their daily life or business, *before* the investigation began.
    - **Examples:** Canceled checks, letters, applications, signed contracts.
    - **Advantage:** They represent the person's natural and unconscious writing habits.

2.  **Requested Standards:** These are handwriting or signature samples that the subject is asked to provide for the purpose of the investigation.
    - **Procedure:** The subject is asked to write specific words or phrases multiple times on a prepared form. The process is dictated by the investigator to ensure the sample is adequate.
    - **Advantage:** The content can be controlled to match the words on the questioned document.
    - **Disadvantage:** The subject may be nervous or may try to deliberately disguise their handwriting.

**Board Exam Tip:** Collected standards are generally considered more reliable than requested standards because they are less likely to be deliberately altered by the writer. A good QDE will use a combination of both whenever possible.

## III. The Scientific Instruments of QDE

The QDE relies on a range of scientific instruments to look beyond what the naked eye can see.

- **Stereoscopic Microscope:** The most important and frequently used instrument. It provides a three-dimensional, magnified view of the document, allowing the examiner to see fine details like pen lifts, hesitations, and patching, which are often indicative of forgery.

- **Video Spectral Comparator (VSC):** A powerful instrument that uses different wavelengths of light (from ultraviolet to infrared) and various filters to analyze inks and paper.
    - **Ink Differentiation:** Two inks that look identical to the naked eye may appear different under infrared light, revealing an alteration.
    - **Revealing Alterations:** Can reveal erased or obliterated writing.

- **Electrostatic Detection Apparatus (ESDA):** A non-destructive method used to visualize **indented writing**. When someone writes on a top sheet of paper in a notepad, an impression is left on the sheets below. The ESDA can develop these impressions, which can be a crucial source of evidence.

- **Chromatography:** A destructive method used to separate the chemical components of ink. It is used to compare the composition of different inks.

## IV. Forgery and Its Detection

**Forgery** is the act of falsely making or materially altering a writing, with the intent to defraud.

### A. Classes of Forged Signatures
1.  **Simple/Spurious Forgery:** A forgery written by a forger who has no knowledge of the appearance of the genuine signature. They simply write the victim's name in their own handwriting. This is the easiest type of forgery to detect.
2.  **Simulated/Freehand Forgery:** The forger attempts to copy or imitate a genuine model signature. This is an act of "drawing" rather than writing, and it often contains signs of the forger's struggle to make an accurate copy.
3.  **Traced Forgery:** The forger traces over a genuine signature. This can be done using a light source (like a lightbox), a carbon paper intermediate, or by tracing over an indentation.

### B. Common Indicators of Forgery (The "Badges of Forgery")
When a forger tries to simulate or trace a signature, they must write slowly and carefully. This slow, deliberate process often leaves behind tell-tale signs that are absent in a person's natural, fluid handwriting.

- **Hesitations and Pen Lifts:** Unnatural stops and starts in places where a genuine writer would not lift their pen.
- **Tremor:** The writing appears shaky or uncertain.
- **Patching or Retouching:** The forger goes back to fix or improve a letterform after writing it.
- **Unnatural Slant and Proportions:** The letters are not consistent in their size and slant.
- **Slow, Drawn-Out Quality:** The ink line lacks the "fluidity" of genuine writing, appearing more like a drawing.
- **Identical Signatures:** No one signs their name exactly the same way twice. If two signatures are perfectly identical, it is overwhelming evidence that one or both are traced or digitally reproduced. This is a cardinal rule of handwriting examination.

## V. Other Types of Document Alterations

- **Erasures:** The removal of writing from a document.
    - **Mechanical Erasure:** Using a rubber eraser or scraping the paper's surface. Can often be detected by disturbances in the paper fibers.
    - **Chemical Erasure:** Using a chemical to bleach the ink. Can often be detected with UV or infrared light.
- **Obliterations:** The overwriting of original text with another ink or marker to make it unreadable. A VSC can often see through the obliterating ink.
- **Additions:** Adding words or numbers to a document after it was completed.
- **Insertions:** Inserting a new page into a multi-page document.

## Conclusion

The examination of questioned documents is a meticulous scientific discipline that requires extensive training and experience. The QDE combines knowledge of writing systems, manufacturing processes of paper and ink, and skill in microscopy and other instrumentation to uncover the history of a document. By identifying forgeries and revealing alterations, the QDE plays a crucial role in protecting against fraud and ensuring that the truth, as recorded on paper, is brought to light.
