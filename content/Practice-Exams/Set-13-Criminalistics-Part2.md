### What is the primary concern of forensic ballistics?

- [ ] The study of projectile motion in flight.
- [x] The identification of firearms, bullets, and cartridge cases.
- [ ] The analysis of explosive devices.
- [ ] The study of the impact of projectiles on targets.

> Explanation: Forensic ballistics is the science of analyzing firearms and ammunition components (bullets, cartridge cases) to establish if a specific firearm was used in a crime.

### The unique microscopic scratches and impressions left on a bullet and cartridge case by a firearm are called:

- [ ] Class characteristics
- [x] Striations or individual characteristics
- [ ] Rifling marks
- [ ] Land and groove impressions

> Explanation: These unique and reproducible markings, known as striations, are created by imperfections in the barrel and breech face. They act as the firearm's "fingerprint."

### The spiral grooves cut into the bore of a firearm barrel to impart spin on a bullet are known as:

- [ ] Striae
- [x] Rifling
- [ ] Caliber
- [ ] Breech marks

> Explanation: Rifling (composed of lands and grooves) is intentionally created during manufacturing to make the bullet spin, improving its stability and accuracy in flight.

### Which instrument is indispensable for comparing the markings on a test-fired bullet with a crime scene bullet?

- [ ] Stereomicroscope
- [x] Comparison Microscope
- [ ] Gas Chromatograph
- [ ] Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

> Explanation: A comparison microscope allows a firearms examiner to view two objects (like two bullets or two cartridge cases) side-by-side in the same field of view to look for matching striations.

### The diameter of the bore of a rifled firearm, usually expressed in hundredths of an inch or millimeters, is its:

- [ ] Gauge
- [x] Caliber
- [ ] Headstamp
- [ ] Rifling twist

> Explanation: Caliber is a fundamental class characteristic that refers to the nominal diameter of the firearm's barrel.

### Gunshot residue (GSR) tests are primarily performed to:

- [ ] Determine the exact time a firearm was discharged.
- [x] Determine if an individual has recently fired or been in close proximity to a firearm when it was discharged.
- [ ] Identify the specific type of firearm used.
- [ ] Measure the distance from the muzzle to the target.

> Explanation: GSR tests detect the presence of primer residues (typically lead, barium, and antimony) on a person's hands, clothing, or other surfaces.

### Forensic toxicology is primarily concerned with the:

- [ ] Identification of illegal drugs in powder form.
- [x] Detection and interpretation of drugs and poisons in body fluids and tissues.
- [ ] Analysis of trace evidence like hair and fibers.
- [ ] Examination of blood spatter patterns.

> Explanation: Forensic toxicologists analyze biological samples to identify the presence of alcohol, drugs, or other toxic substances and to assess their role in a person's death, illness, or impairment.

### What is the most common and reliable specimen used for alcohol determination in a living person?

- [ ] Urine
- [x] Blood
- [ ] Saliva
- [ ] Hair

> Explanation: Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the legal standard for determining intoxication because it directly correlates with the amount of alcohol affecting the brain.

### This type of test is used for screening large numbers of specimens for a wide range of drugs.

- [ ] Confirmatory test
- [x] Presumptive or screening test
- [ ] Purity test
- [ ] Microcrystalline test

> Explanation: Presumptive tests (like immunoassays) are rapid and sensitive but less specific. They are used to quickly rule out negative samples and identify which samples need further testing. A positive result must be verified by a confirmatory test.

### Which of the following is considered a "confirmatory test" in drug analysis?

- [ ] Color test
- [ ] Immunoassay
- [x] Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
- [ ] Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)

> Explanation: GC-MS is the gold standard for confirmation. It separates a compound from a mixture (GC) and then provides a specific "fingerprint" of its molecular structure (MS), offering a definitive identification.

### The study of the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms is known as:

- [ ] Pharmacology
- [x] Toxicology
- [ ] Serology
- [ ] Biology

> Explanation: Toxicology is the broad science of poisons, their effects, detection, and the treatment of poisoning. Forensic toxicology is a specialized application of this science.

### What is the primary purpose of a polygraph examination?

- [ ] To force a confession from a suspect.
- [ ] To determine the guilt or innocence of a person.
- [x] To detect deception by monitoring physiological responses to a series of questions.
- [ ] To measure a person's intelligence and personality.

> Explanation: The polygraph, or "lie detector," does not detect lies directly but measures physiological changes (heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, skin conductivity) that are theoretically associated with the stress of deception. Its results are often not admissible in court.

### In a polygraph test, what is the purpose of a "control question"?

- [ ] To get a known truthful answer.
- [x] To elicit a probable lie from the subject to create a baseline physiological response for comparison.
- [ ] To check if the polygraph instrument is working correctly.
- [ ] To ask directly about the crime under investigation.

> Explanation: A control question is a question about a minor misdeed to which the subject will likely lie (or be anxious about), providing a measure of their physiological response to deception. This is compared to their response to relevant (crime-related) questions.

### Which of the following is NOT one of the physiological responses typically measured by a polygraph?

- [ ] Respiration rate
- [ ] Cardiovascular activity (blood pressure and heart rate)
- [ ] Electrodermal activity (perspiration)
- [x] Brain wave patterns

> Explanation: A standard polygraph measures responses from the respiratory, cardiovascular, and sweat gland systems. Brain wave patterns are measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is not part of a traditional polygraph test.

### The building blocks of the DNA molecule, which create the "rungs" of the DNA ladder, are known as:

- [ ] Chromosomes
- [x] Nucleotide bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine)
- [ ] Alleles
- [ ] Genes

> Explanation: The DNA double helix is composed of four nucleotide bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G.

### What is the technique used to make multiple copies of a specific segment of DNA?

- [ ] Gel Electrophoresis
- [x] Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
- [ ] Gas Chromatography
- [ ] Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis

> Explanation: PCR is a revolutionary technique that allows scientists to amplify a small amount of DNA into a large enough quantity for analysis, similar to a "molecular photocopier."

### In modern forensic DNA analysis, analysts examine specific locations on the DNA strand called:

- [ ] Genes
- [ ] Chromosomes
- [x] Short Tandem Repeats (STRs)
- [ ] Blood types

> Explanation: STRs are short, repeating sequences of DNA that vary greatly from person to person in the number of repeats. Analyzing multiple STR loci creates a DNA profile that is statistically unique.

### The national DNA database maintained by the FBI in the United States is called:

- [ ] AFIS
- [x] CODIS (Combined DNA Index System)
- [ ] NIBIN
- [ ] PDQ

> Explanation: CODIS enables federal, state, and local forensic laboratories to exchange and compare DNA profiles electronically, thereby linking crimes to each other and to convicted offenders.

### What is the term for one of several alternative forms of a gene at a specific locus on a chromosome?

- [ ] Minutiae
- [x] Allele
- [ ] Helix
- [ ] Base pair

> Explanation: For each STR locus, a person inherits one allele from their mother and one from their father. The combination of alleles at multiple loci makes up their DNA profile.

### Which part of a firearm leaves impressions on the base (headstamp) of a spent cartridge case?

- [ ] The rifling in the barrel
- [x] The breech face and firing pin
- [ ] The ejector and extractor
- [ ] The hammer

> Explanation: When a firearm is discharged, the cartridge case is forced back against the breech face, imprinting its markings. The firing pin also leaves a distinct impression on the primer. The ejector and extractor leave marks as the case is expelled.

### The Marquis Reagent is a presumptive color test for which class of drugs?

- [ ] Marijuana
- [ ] Cocaine
- [x] Opiates (like heroin) and amphetamines
- [ ] Barbiturates

> Explanation: The Marquis Reagent is a common field test used by law enforcement. It turns purple in the presence of heroin and other opiates, and orange-brown in the presence of amphetamines.

### The "4 Rs Rule" in polygraphy refers to the subject's rights. What are they?

- [ ] Right to Remain Silent, Right to Refuse, Right to Rest, Right to Review
- [x] Right to know the Reason, Right to Refuse, Right to have a Lawyer, Right to Rest
- [ ] Reason, Relevance, Respect, and Response
- [ ] Read, Record, Report, and Rectify

> Explanation: Before an examination, the subject must be informed of their rights, including the reason for the test, their right to refuse or stop at any time, and their right to legal counsel.

### The most common source of DNA for forensic testing is:

- [ ] Hair
- [x] Buccal (cheek) swab
- [ ] Blood
- [ ] Saliva

> Explanation: While blood and saliva are excellent sources, a buccal swab is the least invasive, quickest, and most common method for collecting a known DNA reference sample from a person.

### The internal diameter of a shotgun barrel is referred to as its:

- [ ] Caliber
- [x] Gauge
- [ ] Choke
- [ ] Bore

> Explanation: Gauge is determined by the number of lead balls of a size equal to the barrel's diameter that would weigh one pound. A smaller gauge number means a larger barrel diameter.

### What is the scientific basis for the reliability of polygraph examinations?

- [ ] The "Pinocchio effect" where lying causes physical changes.
- [x] The theory that the act of deception is associated with involuntary physiological changes.
- [ ] The accuracy of the questions asked by the examiner.
- [ ] It has no accepted scientific basis and is considered pseudoscience by many.

> Explanation: The underlying theory is the "fight or flight" response—that fear of detection causes measurable, uncontrollable physiological arousal. However, the validity and reliability of this theory are highly debated in the scientific community.

### What is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis useful for?

- [ ] Identifying a specific individual with high certainty.
- [x] Testing samples where nuclear DNA is degraded, such as old bones or hair shafts.
- [ ] Determining the father in a paternity case.
- [ ] Linking a suspect to a recent crime scene.

> Explanation: mtDNA is inherited only from the mother and is not unique to an individual but is shared by all maternal relatives. Its main advantage is its high copy number and resilience, making it useful for testing degraded samples like old skeletal remains or hair shafts (which lack nuclear DNA).

### When a bullet strikes a target, the end of the track it creates is known as the:

- [ ] Point of entry
- [x] Terminal point
- [ ] Trajectory
- [ ] Ricochet point

> Explanation: The path of the bullet is its trajectory. The point where it stops or exits is its terminal point. The overall study is often called terminal ballistics.

### A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed itself is called a:

- [ ] Reagent
- [x] Catalyst
- [ ] Solvent
- [ ] Precipitate

> Explanation: In chemistry, a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction. This concept is relevant in understanding various chemical tests and biological processes.

### Which component of a cartridge contains the chemical mixture that ignites the gunpowder?

- [ ] The bullet
- [ ] The shell casing
- [x] The primer
- [ ] The propellant

> Explanation: The firing pin strikes the primer, causing a small explosion that ignites the main propellant (gunpowder), which in turn creates the gas pressure to propel the bullet.

### The specific pattern of blood stains at a crime scene can be used to reconstruct events. This field of study is called:

- [ ] Forensic Serology
- [x] Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA)
- [ ] Forensic Biology
- [ ] Hemotology

> Explanation: BPA involves the study of the size, shape, distribution, and location of bloodstains to determine the physical events that gave rise to them, such as the type of weapon used or the position of the victim and assailant.
