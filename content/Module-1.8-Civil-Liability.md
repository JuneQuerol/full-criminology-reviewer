# Module 1.8: Civil Liability Arising from Crime

## 1. Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the fundamental principle that every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable.
- Differentiate the sources of civil liability and identify the scope of civil liability arising from crime (ex delicto).
- Identify the persons who are civilly liable for a crime, including principal and subsidiary liabilities.
- Define and distinguish restitution, reparation, and indemnification for consequential damages.
- Enumerate and explain the different kinds of damages that may be awarded in case of death.
- Determine the rules on the extinction and survival of civil liability in relation to criminal liability.

## 2. CONCEPT OF CIVIL LIABILITY (Art. 100-113, RPC)

### Every person criminally liable is also civilly liable
**Art. 100, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** "Every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable."

This is the bedrock principle of civil liability *ex delicto* (arising from a crime). The commission of a crime causes two kinds of injuries:
1.  **Social Injury:** The breach of the sovereign rights of the State. This is remedied by criminal action and punished through a penalty.
2.  **Personal Injury:** The harm done to the private victim. This is repaired through civil liability, which includes restitution, reparation, and indemnification.

**Exception:** There is no civil liability in crimes where there is no private offended party or material damage, such as espionage, violation of neutrality, and contempt of court.

### Sources of Civil Liability
Civil obligations arise from:
1.  **Law:** (e.g., duty to pay taxes)
2.  **Contracts:** (e.g., obligation to repay a loan)
3.  **Quasi-contracts:** (e.g., negotiorum gestio, solutio indebiti)
4.  **Acts or omissions punished by law (Crimes / Delicts):** This is the focus of this module.
5.  **Quasi-delicts (Torts):** (e.g., causing damage through negligence without a pre-existing contract)

### Civil Liability Ex Delicto
This refers specifically to the civil liability that is a direct consequence of a criminal act. The civil action to recover this liability is deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately, or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.

## 3. PERSONS CIVILLY LIABLE

### A. Principal Liability of the Offender
The person who is found guilty of committing the felony is the one principally liable to pay for the damages he caused. The principals, accomplices, and accessories are each liable for their own share of the civil liability.

### B. Subsidiary Liability (Art. 102-103)
In case the person principally liable is insolvent, the law provides that other persons may be held liable.

1.  **Innkeepers, Tavernkeepers, and Proprietors of Establishments (Art. 102):**
    - Liable for crimes committed in their establishments if a guest notifies them of the deposit of their goods and they fail to take precautions.
    - Robbery or theft of guest's effects by the innkeeper's employees or by strangers, after being deposited with said innkeeper.
    - Not liable if the loss is due to force majeure or is the fault of the guest.

2.  **Employers (Master and Servant Rule) (Art. 103):**
    - Employers shall be subsidiarily liable for the felonies committed by their employees in the discharge of their duties.
    - **Applies to:** Industries and other establishments.
    - **Requisites for Employer's Subsidiary Liability:**
        1.  The employer is engaged in some kind of industry or business.
        2.  The employee committed the crime in the discharge of their duties.
        3.  The employee is insolvent and cannot pay the civil liability.
        4.  There is a final judgment convicting the employee.

3.  **Teachers and Persons in Loco Parentis:**
    - Under the Family Code, this liability is now direct and primary, not subsidiary, and is based on the principle of *patria potestas*. It is more of a liability under quasi-delict. However, for purposes of the RPC, their subsidiary liability may arise under certain contexts.

4.  **The State:** The State is liable in the same manner as an employer when it acts through a special agent.

### C. Liability of Legal Persons (Corporations)
Corporations can be civilly liable in the same way natural persons are. While a corporation cannot be imprisoned, it can be ordered to pay damages. Its officers who are responsible for the crime may be held criminally and civilly liable.

## 4. WHAT CIVIL LIABILITY INCLUDES (Art. 104)

The civil liability established in Articles 100, 101, 102, and 103 of this Code includes:
1.  **Restitution**
2.  **Reparation of the damage caused**
3.  **Indemnification for consequential damages**

### A. Restitution (Art. 105)
- **What it is:** The thing itself shall be restored, even though it be found in the possession of a third person who has acquired it by lawful means.
- **When to Restore:** Must be done whenever possible.
- **Exception:** Not applicable if the thing is legally in the possession of a third person who acquired it in good faith.
- **If restitution is not possible:** The court will order payment of the value of the thing.

### B. Reparation of Damage Caused (Art. 106)
- **What it is:** The court shall determine the amount of damage, taking into consideration the price of the thing and its sentimental value to the injured party.
- **When it applies:** This is ordered when restitution is not possible.

### C. Indemnification for Consequential Damages (Art. 107)
- **What it is:** This includes not only those caused the injured party, but also those suffered by his family or by any other person by reason of the wrongful act.
- **Examples:** Medical expenses, loss of earning capacity, and moral damages.

## 5. INDEMNITY IN CASE OF DEATH (Art. 104)

When a crime results in death, the civil liability includes the following damages, as established by jurisprudence:

1.  **Civil Indemnity (Death Indemnity):** This is mandatory and awarded without need of proof other than the fact of death as a result of the crime. The amount is fixed by current jurisprudence (e.g., P75,000 for murder, P50,000 for homicide).
2.  **Moral Damages:** Awarded to compensate the heirs for the mental anguish suffered. Like civil indemnity, it is mandatory in cases of murder and homicide.
3.  **Actual/Compensatory Damages:** These are damages that must be proven with receipts (e.g., hospital bills, funeral expenses). If there is no proof of such expenses, temperate damages may be awarded instead.
4.  **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded when the crime is committed with one or more aggravating circumstances. It is intended to serve as a deterrent to serious wrongdoing.
5.  **Loss of Earning Capacity:** This is awarded to the heirs for the income the deceased would have earned. It is computed based on the victim's age, life expectancy, and net earnings.

## 6. EXTINCTION OF CIVIL LIABILITY

- **When extinguished with criminal liability:**
  - By the death of the accused *before* final judgment.
  - By amnesty, which obliterates the offense and its effects.
  - By absolute pardon.

- **When civil liability survives:**
  - If the criminal case is dismissed, but the dismissal is based on reasonable doubt, the civil action can still be filed.
  - Death of the accused *after* final judgment does not extinguish civil liability. It can be enforced against the decedent's estate.
  - In cases of independent civil actions.

- **Independent Civil Actions (Art. 32, 33, 34 of the Civil Code):**
  - **Art. 32:** For violation of civil and political rights.
  - **Art. 33:** In cases of defamation, fraud, and physical injuries (which includes homicide and murder).
  - **Art. 34:** For refusal or failure of a member of a city or municipal police force to render aid and protection.
  - These actions can proceed independently of the criminal action and require only a preponderance of evidence.

## 7. CIVIL LIABILITY IN SPECIFIC CASES

- **Acquittal (when civil liability remains):**
  - If acquittal is based on reasonable doubt, a civil case for damages may still prosper.
  - If the acquittal is based on a finding that the accused did not commit the act charged, there is no civil liability.
  - If the acquittal is due to an exempting circumstance (e.g., insanity, minority), civil liability subsists.

- **Death of Accused:**
  - **Before final judgment:** Criminal liability is extinguished. Civil liability *ex delicto* is also extinguished. The victim must file a separate civil action against the estate.
  - **After final judgment:** Criminal liability is extinguished, but the civil liability remains and can be enforced against the estate.

- **Exempting Circumstances (Art. 12):**
  - A person who acts under an exempting circumstance (insanity, minority, accident) is not criminally liable but is **civilly liable**.
  - **Exception:** No civil liability in case of an accident if there is no fault or negligence on the part of the actor.
