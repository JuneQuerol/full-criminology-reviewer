## 2. CRIMES AGAINST NATIONAL SECURITY (Art. 114-123, RPC)

### A. TREASON (Art. 114)

*   **Definition:** Treason is a crime committed by a person who owes allegiance to the Philippines, whether a Filipino citizen or an alien residing in the Philippines, who levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid or comfort. It is a war crime; it cannot be committed during peacetime.

*   **Two Ways of Committing Treason:**
    1.  **Levying War:** Requires an actual assembling of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design by force. The purpose must be to overthrow the government.
    2.  **Adherence to the Enemy, Giving them Aid or Comfort:**
        *   **Adherence:** Intellectually or emotionally favoring the enemy; a state of mind.
        *   **Aid or Comfort:** An act that strengthens or tends to strengthen the enemy in the conduct of war against the Philippines, or an act that weakens the power of the Philippines to resist or to attack the enemy.

*   **Elements:**
    1.  Offender owes **allegiance** to the Government of the Philippines (either a citizen or a resident alien).
    2.  The Philippines is in a state of **war**.
    3.  The offender commits an act of either:
        a.  **Levying war** against the government.
        b.  **Adhering to the enemies**, giving them **aid or comfort**.

*   **Two-Witness Rule:** The crime of treason must be proven by the testimony of at least two witnesses to the **same overt act** or by the accused's **confession in open court**.
    *   An "overt act" is the physical activity that constitutes the giving of aid and comfort. The two witnesses must testify to the same act, not just similar acts.

*   **Penalty:**
    *   Filipino Citizen: *Reclusion perpetua* to death and a fine not to exceed P100,000.
    *   Alien: *Reclusion temporal* to death and a fine not to exceed P100,000.

*   **Who Can Commit:**
    *   Primarily, **Filipino citizens**, as they owe permanent allegiance.
    *   **Resident aliens**, who owe temporary allegiance while residing in the Philippines.

### B. CONSPIRACY AND PROPOSAL TO COMMIT TREASON (Art. 115)

        3.  They decide to commit it.
    *   **Proof:** Does not require the Two-Witness Rule. Can be proven by the testimony of one witness or other evidence.

*   **Proposal to Commit Treason:**
    *   **Elements:**
        1.  The Philippines is at war.
        2.  A person has decided to levy war or adhere to the enemy.
        3.  He proposes its execution to some other person or persons.

*   **Penalties:**
    *   Conspiracy: *Prision mayor* and a fine not exceeding P10,000.
    *   Proposal: *Prision correccional* and a fine not exceeding P5,000.

### C. MISPRISION OF TREASON (Art. 116)

*   **Definition:** The crime committed by a person who, owing allegiance to the Philippines and having knowledge of any conspiracy against them, conceals or does not disclose and make known the same as soon as possible to the proper authorities.

*   **Elements:**
    1.  The offender is a **Filipino citizen**.
    2.  He has **knowledge** of a conspiracy to commit treason against the Government.
    3.  He **conceals or does not disclose** it to the governor or fiscal of the province, or the mayor or fiscal of the city in which he resides.

## 3. CRIMES AGAINST THE LAW OF NATIONS

### A. PIRACY (Art. 122)

*   **Definition (RPC):** A crime committed on the high seas by any person not a member of its complement nor a passenger of the vessel, who attacks or seizes the vessel, or seizes the whole or part of its cargo, personal belongings of its complement or passengers.
*   **High Seas:** Any waters on the sea coast which are without the boundaries of the low water mark, although such waters may be in the jurisdictional limits of a foreign government. Philippine waters are also considered high seas for the purpose of piracy.
*   **Elements:**
    1.  The attack is upon or seizure of any vessel.
    2.  It is committed on the high seas or in Philippine waters.
    3.  The offenders are not members of its complement or passengers.
    4.  There is intent to gain (*animo lucrandi*).

*   **Distinction from Robbery:**
    *   **Venue:** Piracy is committed on the high seas/Philippine waters; Robbery is generally on land.
    *   **Jurisdiction:** Piracy is a crime against the law of nations, triable in any country; Robbery follows territorial jurisdiction.
    *   **Offenders:** In piracy, offenders cannot be crew or passengers; in robbery on a vessel, they can be.

*   **PD 532 (Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974):**
    *   Defines piracy more broadly to include attacks in Philippine waters, whether from the sea or from the land. It includes any person, including a passenger or crew member.

### B. QUALIFIED PIRACY (Art. 123)

*   Piracy becomes qualified when the pirates commit any of the following crimes:
    1.  They seize the vessel by boarding or firing upon the same.
    2.  They abandon their victims without means of saving themselves.
    3.  The crime is accompanied by murder, homicide, physical injuries, or rape.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion perpetua* to Death.

## 4. Comparison Table: Treason vs Espionage vs Misprision

| Basis                 | Treason (Art. 114)                                | Espionage (Art. 117)                               | Misprision of Treason (Art. 116)                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **When Committed**    | Only during wartime.                              | Can be committed in peace or war time.             | When there is a known conspiracy to commit treason. |
| **Who Can Commit**    | Filipino citizens or resident aliens.             | Any person (citizen or alien).                     | Only Filipino citizens.                             |

## 5. Important Distinctions and Notes

*   **Allegiance:** The obligation of fidelity and obedience which individuals owe to their government. Permanent allegiance is owed by citizens; temporary allegiance by resident aliens.
*   **Treason vs. Rebellion:** Treason is levying war against the government for the purpose of adhering to an external enemy. Rebellion is levying war for internal purposes like removing allegiance from the government or its laws.
*   The Two-Witness Rule in Treason applies only to the **overt act** of giving aid or comfort. The adherence element can be proven by other evidence.
*   Piracy under the RPC and Piracy under PD 532 are distinct. PD 532 is broader and covers acts within Philippine waters and by any person, including crew and passengers.

### Answer Key & Explanations

1.  **C) Treason** - Treason is explicitly defined as a war crime.
2.  **B) An American tourist on a two-week vacation in Palawan.** - A tourist does not owe temporary allegiance in the same way a resident alien does. Allegiance is based on a more permanent connection (citizenship) or residence.
3.  **B) The same overt act.** - The rule is strict: both witnesses must have seen the same specific physical act of aid or comfort.
4.  **D) Misprision of Treason** - He is a Filipino citizen who knew of a conspiracy to commit treason and failed to report it.
5.  **C) A foreign spy entering a Philippine naval base to gather confidential data.** - This fits the first mode of committing Espionage under Art. 117.
6.  **B) The Law of Nations** - Piracy is considered *hostis humani generis* (enemy of mankind), making it a crime against the international community.
7.  **C) The jurisdiction and the persons who can commit it.** - Piracy is a crime against humanity triable anywhere, and under the RPC, offenders cannot be crew or passengers. Robbery is territorial.
8.  **C) When the pirates rape a passenger or kill a crew member.** - Art. 123 specifies that piracy is qualified if accompanied by crimes like murder, homicide, or rape.
9.  **D) Concealing a conspiracy to commit treason.** - This is the crime of Misprision of Treason (Art. 116), not Treason itself.
10. **B) Espionage** - This is the second mode of espionage: a public officer disclosing confidential information obtained by reason of his office to a foreign nation. It can be committed during peacetime.
11. **C) Reclusion perpetua to Death** - This is the penalty prescribed for a Filipino citizen who commits treason.
12. **C) Conspiracy to Commit Treason** - There was an agreement (conspiracy) between two or more persons to levy war, and they decided to commit it.
13. **C) Filipino citizen** - Art. 116 specifically states the offender must be a citizen who owes permanent allegiance.
14. **B) Art. 121, RPC** - This article penalizes the act of Flight to Enemy Country.
15. **A) Intent to gain** - Piracy requires intent to gain (*animo lucrandi*). Mutiny is the unlawful resistance to a superior officer or the raising of commotions and disturbances on board a ship against the authority of its commander.
16. **A) Passengers and crew members** - PD 532 broadened the scope of offenders to include any person, removing the RPC's limitation.
17. **C) Intellectually or emotionally favoring the enemy.** - Adherence is the internal state of mind, while aid and comfort are the external acts.
18. **B) The Filipino citizen faces a higher penalty.** - The penalty for a Filipino is *Reclusion perpetua* to death, while for an alien, it starts from *Reclusion temporal*.
19. **C) Inciting to War or Giving Motives for Reprisals** - This is the crime defined under Art. 118.
20. **C) Correspondence with Hostile Country** - The act fits the description under Art. 120, as it contains information useful to the enemy.
21. **A) adhering to the enemies, giving them aid or comfort** - This is the second mode of committing treason under Article 114.
22. **C) Conspiracy to commit treason** - The two-witness rule is a specific requirement for the overt act of treason itself, not for conspiracy, proposal, or misprision.
23. **B) The offenders must not be members of the crew or passengers.** - This is a key element that distinguishes piracy under the RPC from mutiny or robbery by crew members.
24. **A) Violation of Neutrality** - This act directly falls under the definition in Art. 119.
25. **C) Allegiance to an external enemy vs. internal uprising** - Treason involves collaboration with a foreign enemy, while rebellion is an internal armed uprising against the government.
