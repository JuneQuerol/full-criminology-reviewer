### B. PLEA

    *   More than one offense is charged, except when a single punishment for various offenses is prescribed by law.
    *   The criminal action or liability has been extinguished.
    *   The information contains averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse or justification.

*   **When to file:** Before entering a plea.
*   **Effects of sustaining motion:** The case may be dismissed, or the information may be amended.

*   **Pre-trial agreement:** All agreements or admissions made or entered during the pre-trial conference shall be reduced in writing and signed by the accused and counsel; otherwise, they cannot be used against the accused.
*   **Plea bargaining:** The process whereby the accused and the prosecutor in a criminal case work out a mutually satisfactory disposition of the case subject to court approval.
*   **Stipulation of facts:** An agreement between the parties on certain facts, which are then not disputed at trial.

## 5. TRIAL (Rule 119)

### A. ORDER OF TRIAL

1.  The prosecution shall present evidence to prove the charge and, in the proper case, the civil liability.
2.  The accused may present evidence to prove his defense and damages, if any, arising from the issuance of a provisional remedy in the case.
3.  The prosecution and the defense may, in that order, present rebuttal and sur-rebuttal evidence unless the court, in furtherance of justice, permits them to present additional evidence bearing upon the main issue.
4.  Upon admission of the evidence of the parties, the case shall be deemed submitted for decision unless the court directs them to argue orally or to submit written memoranda.

    *   Errors of law or irregularities prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused have been committed during the trial.
    *   New and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial and which if introduced and admitted would probably change the judgment.
*   **Grounds for reconsideration:** Errors of law or fact in the judgment.
