## Answer Key & Explanations

**1. C) Parricide**
*   **Explanation:** The crime is Parricide because the victim, B, is the legitimate father of the offender, A. This relationship is explicitly listed under Article 246 of the RPC.

**2. D) Adoptive parent**
*   **Explanation:** Article 246 specifies the relationship to be with a person's father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or any of his ascendants, or descendants, or his spouse. The Supreme Court has ruled that the special relationship with adoptive parents is not covered by Parricide but by Murder or Homicide, as the law must be strictly construed.

**3. B) The relationship between the offender and the victim**
*   **Explanation:** The defining element of Parricide is the specific family relationship enumerated in Article 246. Without this relationship, the killing would be classified as either Murder or Homicide.

**4. B) The presence of any of the qualifying circumstances listed in the law**
*   **Explanation:** Murder, under Article 248, is the unlawful killing of a person that is attended by any of the qualifying circumstances, such as treachery, evident premeditation, or cruelty. In their absence, the crime is Homicide.

**5. B) Homicide**
*   **Explanation:** Since the killing resulted from a sudden quarrel ("in the heat of anger") and no qualifying circumstances like treachery or evident premeditation were present, the crime is Homicide under Article 249.

**6. A) Evident premeditation**
*   **Explanation:** Evident premeditation is one of the circumstances that qualifies a killing to Murder under Art. 248. Intoxication is an alternative circumstance, relationship is the element of Parricide, and dwelling is a generic aggravating circumstance.

**7. B) Employed means, methods, or forms...**
*   **Explanation:** This is the legal definition of treachery (alevosia) under the RPC. The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack on an unsuspecting victim, leaving them with no means to defend themselves.

**8. D) The offender must be a recidivist.**
*   **Explanation:** The three elements of evident premeditation are: (1) the time of the decision to commit the crime, (2) an overt act showing the offender clung to his determination, and (3) a sufficient time lapse. Being a recidivist is not an element.

**9. A) Homicide**
*   **Explanation:** Article 249 of the RPC defines Homicide by exclusion. It is the unlawful killing of a person that does not fall under the definitions of Parricide (Art. 246) or Murder (Art. 248).

**10. C) Impossible Crime**
*   **Explanation:** This is an impossible crime under Article 4, paragraph 2 of the RPC. The act (shooting) would have been a crime (murder/homicide), but it failed to produce the intended result because of a factual or legal impossibility—the victim was already dead.

**11. C) The duration of the victim's illness, incapacity for labor, or the extent of the injury itself.**
*   **Explanation:** Articles 263, 265, and 266 classify physical injuries based on their consequences, such as loss of a body part (Serious), number of days of required medical attendance (Less Serious), or incapacity for labor (Slight).

**12. A) Serious Physical Injuries**
*   **Explanation:** Under Article 263, if the injury results in the victim becoming insane, imbecile, impotent, or blind, it constitutes Serious Physical Injuries.

**13. B) Less Serious Physical Injuries**
*   **Explanation:** Article 265 defines Less Serious Physical Injuries as those which have incapacitated the offended party for labor for 10 days or more, or have required medical attendance for the same period.

**14. C) Slight Physical Injuries**
*   **Explanation:** Article 266 defines Slight Physical Injuries as those which require medical attendance or incapacitate a person for 1 to 9 days.

**15. B) Maltreatment**
*   **Explanation:** When a person ill-treats another by deed without causing any injury, the crime is Maltreatment under Article 266, paragraph 2. Slapping without injury falls under this.

**16. C) Seduction of a woman who is a virgin over twelve years and under eighteen years of age.**
*   **Explanation:** Seduction is a separate crime against chastity (Article 337/338). The others are all forms of rape defined under RA 8353, which includes carnal knowledge by force and other forms of sexual assault.

**17. C) It extinguishes the criminal liability and the penalty.**
*   **Explanation:** Article 266-C of the RPC states that the subsequent valid marriage between the offender and the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty imposed.

**18. D) Yes, through sexual assault by inserting an object or instrument into his anal or oral orifice.**
*   **Explanation:** While "carnal knowledge" in the traditional sense refers to vaginal penetration, RA 8353 expanded the definition of rape to include sexual assault, which can be committed against any person, regardless of gender.

**19. C) Rape**
*   **Explanation:** Sexual intercourse with a person who is unconscious or otherwise deprived of reason is rape because the victim is incapable of giving consent (Article 266-A).

**20. D) Infanticide**
*   **Explanation:** Article 255 of the RPC specifically defines and punishes Infanticide, which is the killing of any child during the first 72 hours (less than three days) of its life.

**21. B) Murder**
*   **Explanation:** As established jurisprudence clarifies, the relationship created by adoption is not included in the list of relationships for Parricide in Art. 246. Therefore, the crime is properly classified as Murder (if with a qualifying circumstance) or Homicide.

**22. C) Qualifying**
*   **Explanation:** Under Article 266-B, certain circumstances, including the use of a deadly weapon or the rape being committed by two or more persons, qualify the crime and lead to the imposition of the death penalty (now reclusion perpetua without parole).

**23. B) Death Caused in a Tumultuous Affray (Art. 251)**
*   **Explanation:** This specific article applies when a person is killed in a chaotic fight, several people are involved and are known to have inflicted injuries, but the person who inflicted the fatal wound cannot be identified.

**24. B) Homicide, as the elements of murder are generally not present.**
*   **Explanation:** A duel implies a mutual agreement to fight, which negates the element of treachery. While there is intent to kill, the absence of a qualifying circumstance makes the resulting death Homicide.

**25. B) Homicide, under the principle of praeter intentionem**
*   **Explanation:** Praeter intentionem (unintended consequence) is a mitigating circumstance, but it does not change the nature of the crime committed. The offender is still liable for the resulting death (Homicide) because he is responsible for the natural consequences of his unlawful act.

**26. C) Reclusion Perpetua to Death**
*   **Explanation:** Article 246 specifies this penalty for Parricide. It is one of the most severely punished crimes in the RPC.

**27. D) Both B and C are possible, depending on the circumstances.**
*   **Explanation:** Killing a person who is not resisting or posing a danger is unlawful. It would be Homicide at the minimum. If the guard shot the fleeing thief from behind without warning, it could be qualified by treachery, making it Murder.

**28. A) A special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.**
*   **Explanation:** When homicide is committed by reason of or on the occasion of a robbery, the law (Article 294) treats it as a single, indivisible special complex crime, not as two separate offenses.

**29. B) Cruelty**
*   **Explanation:** This is the definition of cruelty as a qualifying circumstance in murder. It involves the deliberate and inhuman augmentation of the victim's suffering for the offender's pleasure.

**30. D) Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide**
*   **Explanation:** In crimes committed through culpable negligence (imprudence), there is no intent to kill. The crime is the result of a lack of foresight or skill. In contrast, Murder, Homicide, and Parricide are intentional felonies where intent to kill is a crucial element.
