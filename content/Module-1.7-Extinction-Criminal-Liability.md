## 2. TOTAL EXTINCTION OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY (Art. 89, RPC)

Criminal liability is totally extinguished by:

### A. Death of the Convict
*   **Effect on Personal and Pecuniary Penalties:** The death of the convict, after final judgment, extinguishes both the personal penalties (like imprisonment) and the pecuniary penalties (fines).
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   **Extinguished:** Civil liability arising from the crime is extinguished ONLY if the death occurs BEFORE final judgment.
    *   **Not Extinguished:** If the convict dies AFTER final judgment, the civil liability is NOT extinguished. The estate of the deceased can be made to satisfy the civil liability.

### B. Service of Sentence
The convict's complete service of the penalty imposed by the court extinguishes the criminal liability. This does not, however, extinguish the civil liability.

### C. Amnesty
*   **Definition and Nature:** Amnesty is an act of the sovereign power (the President, with the concurrence of a majority of all the members of Congress) granting a general pardon to a class of persons, usually for political offenses.
*   **Difference from Pardon:**
    *   Amnesty is granted to a *class* of persons; Pardon is granted to an *individual*.
    *   Amnesty is for *political offenses*; Pardon is usually for *common crimes*.
    *   Amnesty requires the concurrence of Congress; Pardon does not.
    *   Amnesty may be granted before or after conviction; Pardon is granted only after conviction.
*   **Effects:** Amnesty completely extinguishes the penalty and all its effects. It is as if the person never committed the crime.

### D. Absolute Pardon
*   **Definition:** An act of grace from the President which removes the penalties and disabilities imposed by law and restores the person to their civil and political rights.
*   **Effects on Criminal and Civil Liability:** It extinguishes the criminal liability of the offender. However, it does not extinguish the civil liability *ex delicto* (arising from the crime).
*   **Limitations:** The President cannot grant pardon for impeachment cases or for violations of election laws without the favorable recommendation of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC).

### E. Prescription of Crime (Art. 90-91)
The forfeiture or loss of the right of the State to prosecute the offender after the lapse of a certain period.

*   **Periods of Prescription for Different Crimes:**
    *   Crimes punishable by death, *reclusion perpetua* or *reclusion temporal*: **20 years**
    *   Crimes punishable by other afflictive penalties: **15 years**
    *   Crimes punishable by a correctional penalty: **10 years**; except for those punishable by *arresto mayor*, which prescribe in **5 years**.
    *   Libel or other similar offenses: **1 year**
    *   Oral defamation and slander by deed: **6 months**
    *   Light offenses: **2 months**

*   **When Prescription Begins to Run (Art. 91):** The period of prescription shall commence to run from the day on which the crime is discovered by the offended party, the authorities, or their agents.
*   **When Prescription is Interrupted (Art. 91):** The period is interrupted when the complaint or information is filed in court. It is NOT interrupted by the filing of the complaint with the prosecutor's office.

### F. Prescription of Penalty (Art. 92-93)
The loss of the right of the State to execute the final sentence after the lapse of a certain period.

*   **Periods for Different Penalties:**
    *   Death and *reclusion perpetua*: **20 years**
    *   Other afflictive penalties: **15 years**
    *   Correctional penalties: **10 years**; except for *arresto mayor* which prescribes in **5 years**.
    *   Light penalties: **1 year**

*   **When Prescription Begins (Art. 93):** The period of prescription of penalties shall commence to run from the date when the convict evades the service of his sentence.

### G. Marriage of the Offended Woman
In cases of rape, seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness, the subsequent valid marriage between the offender and the offended woman extinguishes the criminal action or penalty.

---

## 3. PARTIAL EXTINCTION OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY (Art. 94, RPC)

### A. Conditional Pardon
*   **Conditions:** The President may grant a pardon with conditions. The offender must accept the conditions.
*   **Violation of Conditions:** If the convict violates any of the conditions, he shall be prosecuted for such violation under Art. 159 of the RPC, or the President may order his re-arrest and recommitment to serve the unexpired portion of his original sentence.

### B. Commutation of Sentence
The reduction of the penalty to a lighter one. It is granted by the President. For example, *reclusion perpetua* may be commuted to *reclusion temporal*.

### C. Good Conduct Allowance (GCTA - RA 10592)
A reduction of the period of imprisonment of a prisoner who has shown good behavior.

*   **Rates of Good Conduct Time Allowance:**
    *   **First 2 years of imprisonment:** 20 days reduction for each month of actual service.
    *   **3rd to 5th year:** 23 days reduction for each month.
    *   **6th to 10th year:** 25 days reduction for each month.
    *   **11th year and onwards:** 30 days reduction for each month.
*   **Who May Grant:** The Director of the Bureau of Corrections, the Chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, and/or the Warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail.

### D. Parole
*   **Definition:** The conditional release of an offender from a correctional institution after he has served the minimum of his sentence.
*   **Difference from Probation:** Parole is granted after the offender has served part of his sentence in prison, while probation is a disposition under which a defendant, after conviction, is released subject to conditions and supervision of a probation officer, without serving any prison time.
*   **Board of Pardons and Parole:** The agency in charge of granting and revoking parole.

## 6. Special Rules

*   **Effect of Filing Complaint on Prescription:** The prescription of a crime is interrupted by the filing of the *information or complaint in court*. The filing of the complaint at the prosecutor's office does NOT toll the prescriptive period.
*   **Continuing Crimes and Prescription:** For continuing or transitory crimes, the prescriptive period begins to run from the termination of the unlawful act. The complaint may be filed in any jurisdiction where the offense was committed.
