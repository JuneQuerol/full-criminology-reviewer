*   **Explanation:** Direct Bribery (Article 210, RPC) is committed by a public officer who agrees to perform an act constituting a crime, in connection with the performance of his official duties, in consideration of any offer, promise, gift or present.

*   **Explanation:** Indirect Bribery (Article 211, RPC) is committed by a public officer who accepts a gift offered to him by reason of his office. There is no need for an agreement to do or not to do an act. The acceptance of the gift itself, by reason of the office, constitutes the crime.

**6. B) Malversation**
*   **Explanation:** Under Article 217 of the RPC, the failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal uses.

**12. D) Either B or C, depending on the gravity and nature of the imputation**
*   **Explanation:** Oral defamation is punished as either Grave Oral Defamation or Slight Oral Defamation (Slander) under Article 358 of the RPC, depending on the seriousness and offensiveness of the words uttered.

**13. B) Slight Oral Defamation**
*   **Explanation:** When the defamatory words are uttered in the heat of anger or excitement and without serious intent to malign, the crime is generally considered as slight oral defamation.

**14. B) Slander by Deed**

**21. B) Adultery**

**28. B) Qualified Seduction**
*   **Explanation:** Qualified Seduction (Article 337, RPC) is committed when the seduction is perpetrated by a person in a position of authority, influence, or trust over the victim, such as an ascendant, guardian, or teacher. The use of "abuse of confidence" replaces the element of "deceit."

**29. C) Both the husband and his mistress**
*   **Explanation:** The law holds both the unfaithful husband and his concubine criminally liable. The concubine must have knowledge that the man is married.

**30. C) Concubinage**
*   **Explanation:** By its definition in the RPC, only a husband can commit the crime of concubinage. Adultery is committed by the wife (and her paramour), while rape and acts of lasciviousness can be committed by a person of any gender (especially under modern interpretations and special laws).
