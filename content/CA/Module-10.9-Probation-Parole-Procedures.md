## I. Probation

**Definition:** Probation is a disposition under which a defendant, after conviction and sentence, is **released subject to conditions** imposed by the court and to the supervision of a probation officer. It is a **substitute for imprisonment**.

*Probation = ALTERNATIVE to imprisonment. Instead na makulong ka, pinapayagan ka ng judge na manatili sa labas (community) pero may bantay (probation officer) at may mga rules ka na kailangan sundin. Parang "conditional freedom" - malaya ka pero may conditions!*

- **Legal Basis:** In the Philippines, the adult probation system is governed by **Presidential Decree No. 968**, the "Probation Law of 1976."

  **Board Exam Tip:** PD 968 = Probation Law. Memorize this! Laging lumalabas sa exam!

- **Philosophy:** Probation is based on the belief that some offenders can be rehabilitated more effectively in the community than in prison, and that not all offenders pose a danger to society.

  *Philosophy: "Hindi lahat ng kriminal dapat makulong. Some are better off rehabilitated sa bahay with family support, kesa makasama ang mga hardened criminals sa loob ng prison." Makes sense, di ba?*

### A. Purpose and Benefits of Probation
- **Promotes Rehabilitation:** Allows the offender to remain in the community, maintain family ties, and keep their job, which are all crucial for successful reintegration.
- **Reduces Prison Overcrowding:** It is a key tool for easing the burden on the country's congested jails and prisons.
- **Cost-Effective:** Supervising an offender in the community is significantly cheaper than incarcerating them.
- **Provides Restitution:** Allows the offender to work and pay restitution to the victim of their crime.

### B. The Probation Process under PD 968

1.  **Application:** After an offender has been convicted and sentenced, they may apply for probation. The application must be filed with the trial court **within the period for perfecting an appeal** (usually 15 days).
    - **Crucial Point:** An application for probation is a **waiver of the right to appeal**. An offender cannot appeal their conviction *and* apply for probation at the same time. They must choose one.

    *SUPER IMPORTANT: Pag nag-apply ka ng probation, WAIVED mo na ang right mo mag-appeal! Ibig sabihin, tanggap mo na yung conviction mo, gusto mo lang na sa labas ka lang magbago instead na makulong. Hindi pwedeng "I appeal tapos I also want probation." Piliin mo: Appeal OR Probation. Dalawa yan!*

    **Board Exam Tip:** Probation application = WITHIN 15 DAYS from judgment + WAIVER of right to appeal. Memorize this rule!

2.  **Post-Sentence Investigation:** The court will order the **Parole and Probation Administration (PPA)** to conduct a post-sentence investigation. A probation officer will investigate the offender's character, background, and the circumstances of the crime to determine if they are a suitable candidate for probation. The officer will submit a **Post-Sentence Investigation Report (PSIR)** to the court with a recommendation.

    *Parang "background check" ito. Titingnan nila: "Sino ka ba? First offense mo ba? May trabaho ka ba? May family support ka ba? Safe ka ba i-release sa community?" Then irerekemend nila sa judge kung deserve mo ba ng probation.*

3.  **Grant or Denial:** The court makes the final decision. The court may grant probation if it finds that:
    - The offender is not in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most effectively by commitment to an institution.
    - There is no undue risk that the offender will commit another crime.
    - Probation will not depreciate the seriousness of the offense.

    *In short: Kung hindi ka dangerous, kung unlikely ka mag-commit ng bagong crime, at kung hindi masyadong serious ang crime mo - may chance ka ma-grant ng probation!*

### C. Who is Disqualified from Probation?
PD 968 specifies several categories of offenders who are **disqualified** from being granted probation:
- Those sentenced to a prison term of **more than 6 years**.

  *Ito yung PINAKA-IMPORTANT! If sentenced ka ng 6 years and 1 day or more, AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIED ka na sa probation. No exceptions!*

- Those convicted of any crime against the national security or the public order.

  *Crimes like treason, rebellion, sedition - bawal sa probation yan. Too serious.*

- Those who have previously been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than one month and one day and/or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos.

  *May previous conviction ka na before? Sorry, disqualified ka. Probation is only for FIRST-TIME OFFENDERS with clean record!*

- Those who have been once on probation under the provisions of this Decree.

  *One chance lang ang probation! Pag nag-probation ka na before, hindi ka pwede mag-probation ulit. Parang "one time big time" lang.*

- Those who are already serving sentence at the time the substantive provisions of this Decree became applicable.

  *Pag nakakulong ka na when the law took effect, di ka covered. Only for new cases.*

**Board Exam Tip:** Memorize "MORE THAN 6 YEARS = DISQUALIFIED!" This is the #1 probation disqualification rule! Anything 6 years or less, eligible. More than 6 years, bawal na!

### D. Conditions and Revocation
- If probation is granted, the offender (now called a **"probationer"**) must abide by a set of conditions, which always include reporting regularly to a probation officer and not committing another crime.
- **Revocation:** If the probationer violates the conditions of their probation, the probation officer can recommend that the court **revoke** the probation. If revoked, the court will order the probationer to serve their original prison sentence.

**Summary: Probation vs. Parole**

| Feature | Probation | Parole |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What is it?**| An alternative to prison. | An early release from prison. |
| **Who grants it?** | The Judge / Court. | The Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP). |
| **When is it granted?**| After conviction, instead of incarceration. | After serving the minimum prison sentence. |
| **Supervising Agency**| Parole and Probation Administration (PPA) | Parole and Probation Administration (PPA) |
| **Subject** | Probationer | Parolee |

**Non-Institutional Corrections**, also known as community-based corrections, refers to the supervision of criminal offenders in the community as an alternative to incarceration. The two main forms of community-based corrections are **Probation** and **Parole**. While both involve supervision within the community, they are distinct processes that occur at different stages of the criminal justice system. This module will define and differentiate between probation and parole, and outline the basic procedures for their application and administration in the Philippines.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define Probation and Parole and differentiate between the two.
- Identify the purpose and benefits of probation.
- Understand the eligibility requirements and application process for probation under PD 968.
- Describe the role of the Parole and Probation Administration (PPA) and the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP).
- Explain the concept of conditions of probation/parole and the consequences of revocation.


## II. Parole

**Definition:** Parole is the **conditional release of a prisoner** from a correctional institution after they have served the **minimum** of their prison sentence. It is an administrative function, not a judicial one.

*Parole = "early release" from prison. Nakulong ka na, nag-serve ka ng minimum sentence mo, tapos pinakawalan ka ng Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP) dahil nag-behave ka naman. Pero may conditions pa rin!*

- **Parole vs. Probation:**
    - **Probation** is an alternative to imprisonment (the person does not go to prison).

      *Probation = "BEFORE imprisonment" (alternative). Hindi ka nakulong.*

    - **Parole** is a release *from* prison.

      *Parole = "AFTER partial imprisonment" (early release). Nakulong ka na, pinalabas ka lang ng maaga.*

    - Probation is granted by a **judge (the court)**.

      *Judge = judicial function*

    - Parole is granted by the **Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP)**.

      *BPP = administrative/executive function*

**Board Exam Tip:** Madaling tandaan: PROBATION = "PRIOR to prison" (bago makulong), PAROLE = "PARTIAL sentence served" (nakulong na pero pinalabas ng maaga). Pareho silang supervised release, pero iba ang timing kung kailan binigay!

### A. The Purpose of Parole
- To serve as an incentive for good behavior in prison.
- To provide a period of supervised transition from the highly structured life in prison back into the community.
- To help manage the prison population.

### B. The Parole Process

1.  **Eligibility:** A prisoner becomes eligible for parole consideration once they have served the **minimum** of their indeterminate sentence.
2.  **Review by the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP):** The BPP will review the prisoner's case, considering factors such as:
    - The seriousness of their crime.
    - Their behavior and disciplinary record while in prison.
    - Their progress in rehabilitation programs.
    - A psychiatric and risk assessment.
3.  **Grant or Denial:** The BPP, acting as a quasi-judicial body, decides whether to grant or deny parole. The decision is based on whether the Board believes the prisoner is ready for release and is no longer a danger to society.

### C. Conditions and Revocation
- If parole is granted, the released prisoner (now called a **"parolee"**) is placed under the supervision of a parole officer from the **Parole and Probation Administration (PPA)**.
- The parolee must abide by a strict set of conditions.
- **Revocation:** If the parolee violates the conditions of their parole, the BPP can issue a warrant for their arrest and order them to be returned to prison to serve the remainder of their original sentence.

**Summary: Probation vs. Parole**
| Feature | Probation | Parole |

## Conclusion

Probation and parole are the two cornerstones of community-based corrections in the Philippines. They provide a mechanism for allowing less dangerous offenders to be rehabilitated within the community, which is both more humane and more cost-effective than mass incarceration. Probation offers a second chance to offenders who might otherwise be drawn into the negative culture of prison life. Parole provides a crucial, supervised bridge for prisoners returning to society, increasing their chances of a successful reintegration. Both systems are managed through a careful process of investigation, supervision, and revocation, balancing the goal of offender rehabilitation with the primary need to ensure public safety.
