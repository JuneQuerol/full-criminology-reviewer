## Answer Key

**1. a) Republic Act No. 3815**
*   **Explanation:** The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines was enacted on December 8, 1930, and is officially designated as Act No. 3815.

**2. d) English Common Law**
*   **Explanation:** Philippine Penal Law is a statutory law and is primarily derived from the Revised Penal Code, special penal laws, and penal presidential decrees. It is not a common law jurisdiction, thus English Common Law is not a primary source.

**3. a) There is no crime when there is no law punishing it.**
*   **Explanation:** This is a fundamental principle of criminal law, also known as the principle of legality. It means that no act can be considered a crime unless there is a specific law that defines it as such and provides a penalty for it.

**4. a) General, Territorial, and Prospective**
*   **Explanation:** These are the three main characteristics of Philippine Criminal Law. **General:** It applies to all persons within the territory. **Territorial:** It applies to offenses committed within the Philippine territory. **Prospective:** It punishes acts committed after the law's effectivity (with some exceptions).

**5. a) Felony**
*   **Explanation:** Article 3 of the RPC defines felonies as acts and omissions punishable by this Code. Offenses are punishable by special laws, while infractions or misdemeanors are minor violations of law or ordinances.

**6. d) All of the above**
*   **Explanation:** Article 3 of the RPC states that felonies are committed through dolo (deceit) or culpa (fault). Culpa includes negligence and imprudence.

**7. b) Frustrated**
*   **Explanation:** This is the definition of a frustrated felony under Article 6 of the RPC. All acts of execution are performed, but the crime is not consummated due to causes independent of the offender's will.

**8. c) Attempted**
*   **Explanation:** This is the definition of an attempted felony under Article 6 of the RPC. The offender begins the commission but does not perform all acts of execution due to a cause other than their own spontaneous desistance.

**9. c) Both a and b**
*   **Explanation:** Article 48 of the RPC defines a complex crime. It exists when a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies (compound crime), or when an offense is a necessary means for committing another (complex crime proper).

**10. e) All of the above**
*   **Explanation:** Justifying, exempting, mitigating, and aggravating circumstances are all modifying circumstances that affect the criminal liability of the offender.

**11. c) Insanity**
*   **Explanation:** Insanity is an exempting circumstance under Article 12 of the RPC. The others are justifying circumstances under Article 11.

**12. d) All of the above**
*   **Explanation:** Article 11(1) of the RPC lists these three as the requisites for lawful self-defense: unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of the means employed, and lack of sufficient provocation.

**13. b) Exempting**
*   **Explanation:** Under Article 12 of the RPC, a person under nine years of age is completely exempt from criminal liability. This has been amended by R.A. 9344 (Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act) to 15 years of age with discernment. However, in the context of pure RPC, nine years is the classic example of an exempting circumstance due to imbecility or insanity. *For board exam purposes, it's crucial to know both the RPC provision and the amendments.*

**14. c) Mitigating**
*   **Explanation:** This is a privileged mitigating circumstance under Article 68, which provides for a penalty lower by one or two degrees than that prescribed by law. The age of minority is specifically treated as a mitigating circumstance.

**15. a) Ordinary Mitigating**
*   **Explanation:** Praeter intentionem, or the fact that the offender had no intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed, is a mitigating circumstance under Article 13(3) of the RPC. It is considered an ordinary or generic mitigating circumstance.

**16. b) Treachery (Alevosia)**
*   **Explanation:** Treachery is a qualifying aggravating circumstance because it changes the nature of the crime (e.g., from homicide to murder). The others are generic aggravating circumstances which only increase the penalty to its maximum period.

**17. a) Recidivist**
*   **Explanation:** This is the definition of recidivism under Article 14(9) of the RPC. The two crimes must be embraced in the same title of the Code.

**18. d) All of the above**
*   **Explanation:** Article 16 of the RPC states that the persons criminally liable for grave and less grave felonies are principals, accomplices, and accessories. For light felonies, only principals and accomplices are liable.

**19. c) Accomplice**
*   **Explanation:** This is the definition of an accomplice under Article 18 of the RPC. They are not principals but they cooperate in the execution through previous or simultaneous acts.

**20. d) By giving moral support to the commission of the crime.**
*   **Explanation:** Giving moral support is not an act of an accessory. An accessory's participation is subsequent to the crime's commission. The acts of an accessory are defined in Article 19 of the RPC.

**21. d) Both a and b**
*   **Explanation:** Article 25 of the RPC classifies penalties into principal and accessory. It also provides a scale of penalties which includes capital, afflictive, correctional, and light penalties.

**22. a) Reclusion perpetua**
*   **Explanation:** As per Article 25 of the RPC, afflictive penalties include reclusion perpetua, reclusion temporal, and prision mayor.

**23. b) 6 years and 1 day to 12 years**
*   **Explanation:** This is the duration of the penalty of prision mayor as provided in Article 27 of the RPC.

**24. d) By prescription of the crime**
*   **Explanation:** Article 89 of the RPC lists the ways criminal liability is totally extinguished. Prescription of the *crime* prevents the State from prosecuting the offender in the first place, while prescription of the *penalty* extinguishes the liability to serve the sentence. Amnesty is also a cause for total extinguishment.

**25. c) 30**
*   **Explanation:** This is based on jurisprudence and administrative guidelines from the Board of Pardons and Parole. Although the RPC itself does not specify this, the application of pardon for those sentenced to reclusion perpetua often requires a minimum service of sentence, with 30 years being a common benchmark before being considered for executive clemency. *Note: R.A. 9346 prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.*

**26. b) Extinguishes both criminal and civil liability arising from the delict.**
*   **Explanation:** The death of the accused after arraignment and during the pendency of a criminal action shall extinguish the civil liability arising from the delict. (People v. Bayotas, G.R. No. 102007)

**27. b) Accessory**
*   **Explanation:** Forfeiture of the instruments and proceeds of the crime is an accessory penalty under Article 45 of the RPC. It is inherent in the principal penalty.

**28. a) The court shall consider the number of mitigating and aggravating circumstances.**
*   **Explanation:** Article 64 of the RPC provides the rules for the application of penalties which contain three periods. If there are no modifying circumstances, the medium period is applied. If there is only a mitigating circumstance, the minimum period is applied. If there is only an aggravating circumstance, the maximum period is applied. If there are both, they are offset.

**29. d) Persons convicted of rebellion or treason.**
*   **Explanation:** Section 2 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103) lists the persons who are not entitled to its benefits. Persons convicted of rebellion or treason are not in the exclusion list, and therefore the ISL applies to them, provided the sentence exceeds one year. The others are explicitly excluded.

**30. a) 20 years**
*   **Explanation:** Article 92 of the RPC provides for the period of prescription of crimes. Crimes punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or reclusion temporal shall prescribe in 20 years.
