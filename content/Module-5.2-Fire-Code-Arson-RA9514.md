## I. Republic Act No. 9514: The Revised Fire Code of the Philippines of 2008

This act is a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 2553 and House Bill No. 4115, enacted to ensure public safety and economic development through the prevention and suppression of all kinds of destructive fires.

### Key Principles and Definitions:
- **Purpose:** To prevent and suppress destructive fires, investigate their causes, provide fire safety education, and enforce laws and regulations related to fire prevention and protection.
- **Abatement:** Any act that removes or neutralizes a fire hazard.
- **Fire Hazard:** Any condition or act which increases or may cause an increase in the probability of the occurrence of fire, or which may obstruct, delay, hinder or interfere with firefighting operations and the safeguarding of life and property.
- **Fire Trap:** A building unsafe in case of fire because it will burn easily or because it lacks adequate exits or fire escapes.

### Prohibited Acts and Penalties:
The Fire Code focuses primarily on administrative and regulatory compliance to prevent fires. Violations are treated as matters of public safety and often result in fines, closure of buildings, or abatement of hazards. Criminal liability is primarily covered by the Arson Law (P.D. 1613).

1.  **Failure to Provide Safety Measures:** Failure to provide, install, or maintain fire safety equipment, or to provide adequate exits in buildings or structures.
    - **Penalty:** Administrative fines ranging from **P12,500 to P50,000**, stoppage of operations, or closure of the building.

    - **Penalty:** Fines and imprisonment as per local ordinances or building policies.

3.  **Obstructing a Fire Exit:** Knowingly blocking or obstructing any designated fire lane or fire exit.
    - **Penalty:** Administrative fines.

4.  **Overcrowding:** Allowing a building or space to be occupied by more persons than its prescribed capacity.
    - **Penalty:** Administrative fines and stoppage of operations.

5.  **Removing or Destroying Fire Protection Equipment:** Unauthorized removal, destruction, or tampering of any fire protection or fire fighting equipment.
    - **Penalty:** Administrative fines.
