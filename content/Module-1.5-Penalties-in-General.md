# Module 1.5: Penalties in General

## 1. Learning Objectives

*   Understand the definition and juridical conditions of penalty.
*   Differentiate between principal and accessory penalties as classified under the Revised Penal Code.
*   Memorize the duration of various penalties and their classifications (afflictive, correctional, light).
*   Explain the application of the Three-fold Rule (Art. 70) and the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103).
*   Apply the concepts of penalties to solve hypothetical legal problems relevant to the Criminology Licensure Exam.

## 2. Definition of Penalty

A **penalty** is the suffering inflicted by the State, for the transgression of a law, in accordance with a judgment of a competent court. It is a coercive measure to ensure that legal norms are respected and obeyed.

*Ang **penalty** o parusa ay ang pagpapahirap na ipinapataw ng gobyerno sa isang taong lumabag sa batas. Ito ay desisyon ng korte para masigurong sinusunod ang batas at para maging leksyon sa nagkasala.*

## 3. Juridical Conditions of Penalty

For a penalty to be considered sound and valid under the classical school of thought in criminal law, it must possess the following qualities:

1.  **Productive of suffering** - It must be painful to the offender, but without affecting the integrity of the human personality.
2.  **Commensurate with the offense** - The penalty must be proportional to the gravity of the crime committed.
3.  **Personal** - The penalty must be imposed only upon the person who has committed the crime. No one should be punished for the crime of another.
4.  **Legal** - The penalty must be one that is prescribed by law and imposed by a competent court.
5.  **Equal** - The penalty must be applied to all who commit the same offense, regardless of social status, wealth, or other personal circumstances.
6.  **Certain** - No one may escape the effects of a penalty to which they have been sentenced.
7.  **Correctional** - The penalty should aim to correct and reform the offender.

## 4. Classification of Penalties under the RPC (Art. 25)

Penalties are classified into two main groups:

### A. Principal Penalties

These are penalties that can be imposed independently.

| Classification      | Penalties                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capital Punishment** | Death (execution is suspended by R.A. 9346)                                                          |
| **Afflictive Penalties**| Reclusion perpetua, Reclusion temporal, Perpetual or temporary absolute disqualification, Prision mayor |
| **Correctional Penalties**| Prision correccional, Arresto mayor, Suspension, Destierro                                             |
| **Light Penalties**     | Arresto menor, Public censure                                                                         |

### B. Accessory Penalties (Art. 40-45)

These are penalties that are deemed included in the imposition of the principal penalty.

1.  **Perpetual or temporary absolute disqualification**
2.  **Perpetual or temporary special disqualification**
3.  **Suspension from public office, the right to vote and be voted for**
4.  **Civil interdiction** - Prohibits the offender from managing their property and disposing of it by any act or conveyance inter vivos.
5.  **Indemnification**
6.  **Forfeiture or confiscation of instruments and proceeds of the offense**
7.  **Payment of costs**
8.  **Bond to keep the peace**

*Ang **Principal Penalties** ay ang mga pangunahing parusa tulad ng pagkakulong (e.g., Reclusion Perpetua, Prision Mayor). Ito ang direktang ipinapataw para sa krimen. Ang **Accessory Penalties** naman ay mga "karugtong" o "kasama" na parusa. Halimbawa, kung nakulong ka, kasama na diyan ang pagkatanggal mo sa trabaho sa gobyerno (**disqualification**) at pagbabawal sa iyo na pamahalaan ang iyong ari-arian (**civil interdiction**).*

## 5. DURATION OF PENALTIES (Art. 27, RPC)

| Penalty                  | Duration                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Reclusion perpetua**   | 20 years and 1 day to 40 years           |
| **Reclusion temporal**   | 12 years and 1 day to 20 years           |
| **Prision mayor**        | 6 years and 1 day to 12 years            |
| **Prision correccional** | 6 months and 1 day to 6 years            |
| **Arresto mayor**        | 1 month and 1 day to 6 months            |
| **Arresto menor**        | 1 day to 30 days                         |

## 6. Three-fold Rule (Art. 70, RPC)

Also known as the "consecutive service of sentence" rule. When the offender has to serve two or more penalties, he should serve them simultaneously if the nature of the penalties will so permit. If not, the penalties shall be served successively, following the order of their respective severity.

**Key Limitation:** The maximum duration of the convict's sentence shall not be more than **three times** the length of the most severe penalty imposed upon him. However, the maximum period shall in no case exceed **40 years**.

*Ang **Three-fold Rule** ay simple lang: kung marami kang kaso at pinagsama-sama ang mga sentensya sa iyo, ang maximum na itatagal mo sa kulungan ay hindi dapat hihigit sa **tatlong beses ng pinakamabigat na parusa** na nakuha mo. At kahit anong mangyari, hindi ka pwedeng makulong ng **higit sa 40 taon**. Halimbawa, kung may 3 kang kaso na may sentensyang 10 taon bawat isa (total 30 years), ang maximum na iseserve mo ay 3 x 10 = 30 years. Kung ang sentensya mo ay 20, 20, at 20 (total 60 years), ang maximum mo ay 40 years lang, hindi 60.*

## 7. Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL) - Act No. 4103

The ISL provides for an indeterminate sentence for offenders, consisting of a **minimum term** and a **maximum term**. The purpose is to encourage the prisoner's reformation.

*Ang **Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL)** ay nagbibigay ng pag-asa sa mga preso na makalaya nang mas maaga kung sila ay magpapakabuti. Imbis na isang bagsak na sentensya (e.g., "12 years fixed"), ang sentensya ay may **minimum** at **maximum** (e.g., "6 years to 12 years"). Kapag na-serve na ng preso ang **minimum term**, pwede na siyang mag-apply for parole. Ang layunin nito ay para maging motivation sa preso na mag-reform at magbago.*

*   **How to Determine the Sentence:**
    *   **Maximum Term:** The maximum term is the penalty that would be imposed under the Revised Penal Code, considering any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
    *   **Minimum Term:** The minimum term is within the range of the penalty one degree lower than that prescribed by the Code for the offense.

*   **When ISL is NOT applicable:**
    1.  Offenses punished by death penalty or life imprisonment.
    2.  Those convicted of treason, conspiracy or proposal to commit treason.
    3.  Those convicted of misprision of treason, rebellion, sedition, or espionage.
    4.  Those convicted of piracy.
    5.  Those who are habitual delinquents.
    6.  Those who have escaped from confinement or evaded sentence.
    7.  Those granted conditional pardon who violated its terms.
    8.  Those whose maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed one year.
    9.  Those already sentenced by final judgment when the ISL was approved.

### Answer Key & Explanations

1.  **D - Retributive.** Retribution (the idea of vengeance or "an eye for an eye") is a theory or justification for punishment, but it is not a juridical condition for the penalty itself. The conditions are listed in the module (Personal, Legal, Commensurate, etc.).
2.  **C - 20 years and 1 day to 40 years.** As per Art. 27 of the RPC.
3.  **C - Three-fold Rule.** This rule is defined in Article 70 of the RPC.
4.  **C - Reclusion Temporal.** Afflictive penalties are Reclusion perpetua, Reclusion temporal, and Prision mayor.
5.  **A - Civil Interdiction.** This is the specific effect of civil interdiction as an accessory penalty.
6.  **C - A person whose maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed one year.** This is one of the specific exceptions listed under Act No. 4103.
7.  **A - 30 years.** The three-fold rule states the maximum service shall not be more than three times the most severe penalty (3 x 10 = 30 years). Since 30 years does not exceed the 40-year cap, it is the correct answer.
8.  **B - Correctional.** Prision Correccional is explicitly classified as a correctional penalty under Art. 25 of the RPC.
9.  **B - 1 month and 1 day to 6 months.** As defined in Art. 27 of the RPC.
10. **B - Destierro.** This is the definition of the penalty of destierro, which is a form of banishment.
11. **A - Public Censure.** Under Art. 25, the light penalties are Arresto Menor and Public Censure.
12. **C - Integrity of the human personality.** This is a key principle of modern penology, ensuring that punishment is not dehumanizing.
13. **B - R.A. 9346.** This law is entitled "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines."
14. **C - One degree lower.** The ISL requires the minimum term to be within the range of the penalty one degree lower than that prescribed for the offense.
15. **B - Prision Mayor.** The scale of penalties in the RPC is hierarchical. Prision Mayor is one degree lower than Reclusion Temporal.
16. **D - Personality.** This juridical condition means the penalty must be inflicted only on the offender.
17. **A - Principal Penalty.** This is the definition of a principal penalty.
18. **C - Suspension from public office.** The others are principal penalties. Suspension is both a principal and accessory penalty, but among the choices, it is the clear example of an accessory penalty.
19. **A - 1 to 30 days.** As defined in Art. 27 of the RPC.
20. **C - Commensurability.** This principle ensures that the punishment fits the crime.
21. **B - He is exempted from the Indeterminate Sentence Law.** One of the exceptions to the ISL is for those who have violated the terms of a conditional pardon. They must serve the original sentence without the benefit of ISL.
22. **A - Perpetual absolute disqualification and civil interdiction.** According to Art. 41 of the RPC, the penalty of Reclusion Temporal carries with it the accessory penalties of civil interdiction for life or during the sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.
23. **C - Uplift and redeem valuable human material.** This is the primary purpose of the ISL, focusing on reformation.
24. **C - 6 years and 1 day to 12 years.** This is the duration of Prision Mayor as per Art. 27 of the RPC.
25. **D - Equal.** This principle ensures that the law is applied fairly to everyone, without discrimination.
