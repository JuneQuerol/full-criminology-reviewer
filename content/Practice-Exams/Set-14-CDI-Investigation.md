### What is the primary and most crucial duty of the first responder at a crime scene?

- [ ] To immediately arrest suspects.
- [x] To preserve life and render aid to the injured.
- [ ] To start collecting evidence.
- [ ] To call the media.

> Explanation: The first priority for any officer arriving at a crime scene is to assess the scene for safety and render immediate medical assistance to any injured persons. Evidence preservation is secondary to preserving life.

### The systematic search of a crime scene is done to:

- [ ] Finish the investigation quickly.
- [ ] Create confusion for any potential suspects.
- [x] Ensure that all relevant physical evidence is located and collected.
- [ ] Practice search techniques.

> Explanation: A methodical and systematic search pattern (e.g., grid, spiral, strip) is employed to ensure that no part of the crime scene is overlooked and all potential evidence is discovered.

### A rough sketch of the crime scene is drawn by the investigator at the scene. What is its primary purpose?

- [ ] To create a professional-looking diagram for court.
- [x] To accurately record the dimensions of the scene and the location of evidence.
- [ ] To be used as a replacement for photographs.
- [ ] To help the media understand the crime.

> Explanation: The rough sketch is a quick, hand-drawn diagram that captures all critical measurements and locations of objects and evidence. It is used as the basis for creating a polished, to-scale final sketch later.

### This type of evidence, by its very nature, can be linked to a unique and specific source.

- [ ] Class characteristic evidence
- [x] Individual characteristic evidence
- [ ] Testimonial evidence
- [ ] Circumstantial evidence

> Explanation: Individual characteristic evidence, such as DNA, fingerprints, or striations on a bullet, can be traced back to a single source with an extremely high degree of certainty.

### What is the main purpose of establishing a "chain of custody" for evidence?

- [ ] To determine who found the evidence.
- [x] To document the chronological history of who has handled the evidence.
- [ ] To show the evidence to the jury.
- [ ] To prevent the media from accessing the evidence.

> Explanation: The chain of custody is a meticulous log that tracks the possession of an item of evidence from the moment it is collected until it is presented in court. It is essential for proving the integrity and authenticity of the evidence.

### A non-accusatory, structured conversation with a witness or victim to obtain information is called:

- [x] An interview
- [ ] An interrogation
- [ ] A confession
- [ ] A deposition

> Explanation: An interview is typically a non-confrontational, fact-finding process aimed at gathering information. It is less formal than an interrogation, which is designed to elicit incriminating statements from a suspect.

> Explanation: A voluntary informant is motivated by a sense of civic duty or a personal interest in seeing justice served, without seeking any personal gain.

### What are the three primary tools of a criminal investigator?

- [ ] Force, deception, and intimidation
- [x] Information, interview/interrogation, and instrumentation
- [ ] A gun, a badge, and a notebook
- [ ] Logic, luck, and forensics

> Explanation: The "3 I's" of investigation are: Information (the knowledge gathered), Interview/Interrogation (the process of gathering testimonial evidence), and Instrumentation (the use of forensic science and technology).

### This type of investigation involves gathering evidence after a crime has been committed.

- [x] Reactive investigation
- [ ] Proactive investigation
- [ ] Preliminary investigation
- [ ] Follow-up investigation

> Explanation: Reactive investigation is the traditional approach where police respond to a crime that has already occurred. Proactive investigation, by contrast, aims to prevent crime or catch criminals in the act.

### A "buy-bust" operation is a form of:

- [ ] Surveillance
- [x] Entrapment operation
- [ ] Search and seizure
- [ ] Custodial interrogation

> Explanation: In a buy-bust, an undercover officer poses as a buyer to purchase illegal drugs from a suspect, leading to the seller's immediate arrest. This is a form of entrapment operation to catch a person in the act of committing a crime.

### What is the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine?

- [ ] A rule that requires all evidence to be edible.
- [x] A legal principle that makes evidence derived from an illegal search or seizure inadmissible.
- [ ] A guideline for searching orchards for stolen goods.
- [ ] A doctrine related to agricultural crimes.

> Explanation: This doctrine holds that if the "tree" (the initial source of evidence) is tainted by illegality (e.g., an illegal search), then the "fruit" (any evidence derived from that initial source) is also tainted and cannot be used in court.

### Which of the following is the most important quality of a good investigator?

- [ ] Physical strength
- [x] Objectivity and perseverance
- [ ] Having a good informant network
- [ ] Being a good marksman

> Explanation: While many skills are valuable, an investigator must remain objective, unbiased, and persistent in their pursuit of the truth, following leads and evidence wherever they may go.

### This refers to the process of identifying, collecting, preserving, and presenting evidence in a court of law.

- [ ] Criminalistics
- [x] Criminal Investigation
- [ ] Forensic Science
- [ ] Law Enforcement

> Explanation: Criminal investigation is the complete process, from the initial discovery of a crime to the presentation of facts and evidence in a judicial proceeding.

> Explanation: A sting operation is a deceptive operation designed to catch a person committing a crime. For example, setting up a fake pawn shop to buy stolen goods.

### The questioning of a person who is not a suspect but may have information about a crime is an:

- [x] Interview
- [ ] Interrogation
- [ ] Inquest

- [ ] Determining the suspect's alibi.
- [x] Determining the cause and manner of death.
- [ ] Notifying the next of kin.
- [ ] Securing the suspect's confession.

> Explanation: A primary objective in a homicide case is to work with the medical examiner or forensic pathologist to establish the official cause (e.g., gunshot wound) and manner (e.g., homicide, suicide, accident) of death.

### The use of physical force, threats, or psychological pressure to get a confession is known as:

- [ ] A tactic
- [x] Coercion or duress

- [ ] To harass a suspect.
- [x] To gather information about a suspect's activities and associates secretly.
- [ ] To make the police presence known in a high-crime area.
- [ ] To practice for a raid.

> Explanation: Surveillance is a tool for intelligence gathering. It's meant to be covert, allowing investigators to learn about a suspect's habits, contacts, and potential involvement in criminal activity without alerting them.

### The body or substance of a crime, which includes the act and the criminal agency producing it, is the:

- [ ] Modus Operandi
- [x] Corpus Delicti
- [ ] Stare Decisis
- [ ] Habeas Corpus

> Explanation: Corpus delicti, or "body of the crime," refers to the essential facts that prove a crime has been committed. For a homicide, the corpus delicti would be a dead body and evidence that death was caused by a criminal act.

### An investigator who assumes a different identity to infiltrate a criminal organization is working:

- [ ] On a stakeout
- [x] Undercover
- [ ] As a consultant
- [ ] On patrol

> Explanation: Undercover operations are a high-risk, specialized form of investigation where an officer becomes a "part" of the criminal world to gather intelligence from the inside.

### The questioning technique that involves asking a series of questions designed to elicit details and check for consistency is:

- [ ] The Reid Technique
- [x] Cognitive Interviewing
- [ ] The Funnel Approach
- [ ] Cross-examination

> Explanation: The cognitive interview is a technique designed to enhance memory retrieval in cooperative witnesses. It uses various methods to help them recall more details, such as context reinstatement and varied order recall.

### Which of the following is NOT one of the "cardinal points" of investigation?

- [ ] WHO committed the crime?
- [ ] WHAT crime was committed?
- [ ] WHERE was the crime committed?
- [x] WHY was the evidence so hard to find?

> Explanation: The cardinal points of investigation are the classic questions: Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. These guide the entire investigative process.

### The final stage of a criminal investigation is typically:

- [ ] The arrest of the suspect.
- [x] Presenting evidence in court and testifying.
- [ ] Writing the initial incident report.
- [ ] The media press conference.

> Explanation: The investigation culminates in the courtroom, where the investigator presents the evidence they have gathered and provides testimony to support the prosecution's case.

### A "cold case" is one where:

- [ ] The crime occurred in winter.
- [x] All investigative leads have been exhausted, and the case remains unsolved.
- [ ] The suspect has fled to a cold country.
- [ ] The evidence has been contaminated.

> Explanation: A cold case is an unsolved criminal investigation that remains open pending the discovery of new evidence or leads. These cases are often reopened years later if new technology (like DNA) or new information becomes available.
