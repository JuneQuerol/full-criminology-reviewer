## 2. ARREST (Rule 113, Rules of Court)

### A. DEFINITION OF ARREST
**Arrest** is the taking of a person into custody in order that he may be bound to answer for the commission of an offense.

It is made by an **actual restraint** of a person to be arrested, or by his **submission to the custody** of the person making the arrest. The application of actual force, manual touching, or physical restraint is not essential. A person's submission to the will and control of the arresting officer is sufficient.

### B. ARREST WITH WARRANT

#### When Warrant Issues
A warrant of arrest is an order in writing issued in the name of the People of the Philippines, signed by a judge, directed to a peace officer, commanding him to arrest a person and bring him before the court. It is issued upon a finding of **probable cause** by a judge after examining the complainant and witnesses under oath or affirmation.

#### Contents of a Warrant of Arrest
- The name of the accused (or a fictitious name if the true name is unknown).
- The offense charged.
- The name of the court that issued the warrant.
- The signature of the issuing judge.

#### Validity
The warrant of arrest remains valid until it is executed or recalled by the issuing court. The **10-day period** applies to the execution of a **search warrant**, not a warrant of arrest.

#### How Warrant is Executed
The head of the office to whom the warrant of arrest was delivered for execution shall cause the warrant to be executed within **ten (10) days** from its receipt. Within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period, the officer to whom it was assigned for execution shall make a report to the judge who issued the warrant. In case of his failure to execute the warrant, he shall state the reasons therefor.

#### Officer's Duty After Arrest
The officer must bring the arrested person to the nearest police station or jail and deliver them to the proper judicial authorities without unnecessary delay, subject to the time limits prescribed in Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code.

### C. ARREST WITHOUT WARRANT (WARRANTLESS ARREST)

A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person under the following circumstances (Section 5, Rule 113):

1.  **In Flagrante Delicto ("Caught in the Act"):** When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense.
    - **Requirements:**
        - The person to be arrested executed an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime.
        - Such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.

2.  **Hot Pursuit:** When an offense has just been committed, and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it.
    - **Requirements:**
        - An offense has just been committed.
        - The arresting officer has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested committed it. There must be a close temporal connection between the crime's commission and the arrest.

3.  **Escapee:** When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.

#### Citizen's Arrest
A private person may conduct a warrantless arrest under the same circumstances as a peace officer (i.e., in flagrante delicto and hot pursuit). After the arrest, the private person must, without unnecessary delay, turn the arrested person over to the nearest peace officer or prosecutor.

### D. METHOD OF ARREST

- **With or Without Warrant:** The officer shall inform the person to be arrested of the cause of the arrest and the fact that a warrant has been issued, unless the giving of such information would imperil the arrest. The officer need not have the warrant in his possession at the time of the arrest, but after the arrest, if the person arrested so requires, the warrant shall be shown to him as soon as practicable.
- **Right to Break into Building:** An officer, in order to make an arrest either by virtue of a warrant or without a warrant, may break into any building or enclosure where the person to be arrested is or is reasonably believed to be, if he is refused admittance thereto after announcing his authority and purpose.
- **Time of Making Arrest:** An arrest may be made on any day and at any time of the day or night.

### E. RIGHTS OF PERSON ARRESTED (Art. 125, RPC; R.A. 7438)

These are often called the **Miranda Rights**, originating from the US case *Miranda v. Arizona*. Under Philippine law, specifically R.A. 7438, these rights are afforded to any person arrested, detained, or under custodial investigation.

#### Custodial Investigation Rights:
1.  **Right to Remain Silent:** The person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent and that any statement he does make may be used against him.
2.  **Right to Counsel:** He must be informed that he has the right to the assistance of a competent and independent counsel, preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford one, he must be provided with one. This right cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.
3.  **Right to be Informed of Such Rights:** The person must be informed of these rights.

#### Other Rights:
- **Right to Communicate:** The arrested person has the right to communicate with his lawyer, immediate family members, doctor, or any person of his choice.
- **Prohibition against Torture:** No torture, force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used.

#### The 12-18-36 Hour Rule (Article 125, RPC - Delay in the Delivery of Detained Persons)
A public officer who detains a person for some legal ground without a warrant must deliver them to the proper judicial authorities within:
- **12 hours:** for crimes punishable by light penalties.
- **18 hours:** for crimes punishable by correctional penalties.
- **36 hours:** for crimes punishable by afflictive or capital penalties.
*Note: This period does not include weekends or holidays.*

## 3. BAIL (Rule 114)

### A. DEFINITION AND PURPOSE
**Bail** is the security given for the release of a person in custody of the law, furnished by him or a bondsman, to guarantee his appearance before any court as required under the conditions specified.

**Purpose:**
- To relieve an accused from imprisonment until his conviction.
- To secure his appearance at trial. Bail is not intended as a punishment.

### B. WHEN BAIL IS A MATTER OF RIGHT
Bail is a matter of right:
1.  **Before or after conviction** by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, or Municipal Circuit Trial Court.
2.  **Before conviction** by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of an offense not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment.

### C. WHEN BAIL IS A MATTER OF DISCRETION
Bail is a matter of discretion (and subject to a hearing) upon conviction by the RTC of an offense not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment.

No bail shall be granted if the accused is charged with a **capital offense**, or an offense punishable by **reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment**, if the **evidence of guilt is strong**. The burden of proving that the evidence of guilt is strong lies with the prosecution.

### D. FORMS OF BAIL
1.  **Corporate Surety:** A bond underwritten by a surety company accredited by the Supreme Court.
2.  **Property Bond:** A lien or mortgage on real property of the accused or the bondsman. The value of the property must be at least equal to the amount of the bail.
3.  **Cash Deposit:** The accused or any person acting in his behalf may deposit in cash with the nearest collector of internal revenue or provincial, city, or municipal treasurer the amount of bail fixed by the court.
4.  **Recognizance:** An obligation of record, entered into before some court or magistrate duly authorized to take it, with the condition to do some particular act, the most usual condition in criminal cases being the appearance of the accused for trial. It is granted by the court to an indigent person or when required by the circumstances.

### E. BAIL BOND
- **Conditions:** The accused must appear in court whenever required, submit to orders and processes, and in case of conviction, surrender for execution of the judgment.
- **Forfeiture:** If the accused fails to appear, the bond is declared forfeited. The bondsmen are given 30 days to produce the accused and to show cause why judgment should not be rendered against them for the amount of the bond.
- **Cancellation:** The bail bond is cancelled upon the acquittal of the accused, dismissal of the case, or execution of the judgment of conviction.

### Answer Key & Explanations

1.  **C) To secure the appearance of the accused for trial.** - The purpose of bail is not to punish but to ensure the accused attends the trial.
2.  **B) In Flagrante Delicto** - PO1 Cruz personally saw the crime as it was being committed.
3.  **D) Until served or recalled by the court** - A warrant of arrest has no expiration date. The 10-day period is for the officer to report on the action taken.
4.  **B) Right to compulsory process** - This right allows the accused to use the power of the court to summon witnesses and evidence.
5.  **B) 18 hours** - The periods are 12 (light), 18 (correctional), and 36 (afflictive/capital) hours.

7.  **C) Custodial investigation** - These rights are designed to protect a person from coercive interrogation by the state.
8.  **C) Personal loan** - A personal loan is a private financial transaction and is not a recognized form of bail in court.
9.  **C) Arrest** - This is the legal definition of arrest under the Rules of Court.
10. **C) The person to be arrested has just committed an offense in the citizen's presence.** - This is the essence of a citizen's arrest under the in flagrante delicto rule.
11. **C) Double jeopardy** - This constitutional right prevents the state from prosecuting someone for the same crime after an acquittal or conviction.
12. **B) Bail** - This is the definition of bail.
13. **C) Personal knowledge of facts and circumstances** - For a hot pursuit arrest to be valid, the officer must have personal, not second-hand, knowledge.
14. **D) Proof beyond reasonable doubt** - This is the highest standard of proof in criminal cases required to overcome the presumption of innocence.
15. **B) Custodial investigation** - R.A. 7438 specifically details the rights during this stage.

23. **D) Recognizance** - This is a mechanism for release based on the custody of a reputable person, usually for minor offenses or indigent accused.
24. **A) Cannot be forced to testify against himself.** - This is the core of the right against self-incrimination.

27. **B) The giving of such information would imperil the arrest.** - This is the exception to the rule, such as when a suspect is armed and dangerous.
28. **D) The right to be presumed innocent.** - This right is fundamental and cannot be waived. The burden is always on the state to prove guilt.
29. **C) Unlawful, because there is no overt act committed in his presence.** - Mere suspicion or a "suspicious" look is not probable cause for a warrantless arrest. There was no crime being committed, about to be committed, or just committed.
30. **C) The evidence of guilt is strong.** - This is the primary standard used by courts in deciding whether to grant bail for offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment.
