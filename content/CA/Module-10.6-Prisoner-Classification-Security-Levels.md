## I. The Purpose of Prisoner Classification

**Classification** is a method of assessing the risks and needs of each inmate in order to assign them to the housing, security level, and programs that best fit their individual situation. It is the cornerstone of modern prison management.

**Primary Goals of Classification:**

1.  **To Protect Society:** By identifying the most dangerous offenders and ensuring they are held in the most secure facilities, classification helps to prevent escapes and further harm to the public.
2.  **To Protect the Inmates:** By separating violent, predatory inmates from more vulnerable ones, classification helps to maintain safety and order within the prison.
3.  **To Provide for the Effective Control of Inmates:** Assigning inmates to the appropriate security level makes it easier for staff to manage them.
4.  **To Facilitate Effective Rehabilitation:** By identifying an inmate's specific needs (e.g., for drug treatment, education, or vocational training), classification allows for the creation of a personalized treatment plan that has the best chance of success.

## III. The Four Security Levels in the Bureau of Corrections

The BuCor system classifies prisoners into one of four security levels. This classification determines where the inmate will be housed and the level of supervision and restrictions they will be subjected to.

### 1. Maximum Security
- **Who:** This includes the most dangerous and high-risk prisoners.
    - Those sentenced to death (though the death penalty is currently abolished in the Philippines).
    - Those sentenced to life imprisonment.
    - Those with a sentence of 20 years or more.
    - Those who have a history of multiple escapes.
    - Those who are considered to be high-security risks or pose a threat to the prison population.
- **Housing:** They are confined at the **Maximum Security Compound** of the New Bilibid Prison and other similar facilities.
- **Conditions:** Housed in heavily guarded cells, subject to high levels of supervision, and have very limited movement and privileges. They typically wear **tangerine/orange** uniforms.

### 2. Medium Security
- **Who:** This is the largest group of prisoners.
    - Those with a sentence of less than 20 years.
    - Prisoners who were originally classified as maximum security but have shown improvement and good behavior.
- **Housing:** They are confined at the **Medium Security Compound** (Camp Sampaguita) at NBP.
- **Conditions:** They live in dormitories ("brigadas") rather than individual cells. They have more privileges and freedom of movement than maximum-security inmates. They typically wear **blue** uniforms.

### 3. Minimum Security
- **Who:** This includes the lowest-risk prisoners.
    - Those who are physically or mentally handicapped.
    - Those who are 65 years of age or older and are not considered high-risk.
    - Those who have only 6 months or less remaining on their sentence.
    - Those who have shown a sustained period of good behavior and are trusted to serve the remainder of their sentence with minimal supervision.
- **Housing:** They are confined at the **Minimum Security Compound** (Camp Bukang Liwayway) at NBP or at one of the open penal farms (like Iwahig or Sablayan).
- **Conditions:** They have the most freedom of movement and are often allowed to work on agricultural or industrial projects with very little supervision. They typically wear **brown** uniforms.

### 4. Detention Prisoners
- These are individuals awaiting trial whose cases are on appeal. While they are legally considered detention prisoners, they are held in BuCor facilities (if their sentence would qualify them as national prisoners) and are managed separately from the sentenced population.

**Board Exam Tip:** Memorize the three main security levels (Maximum, Medium, Minimum) and the corresponding uniform colors (Orange, Blue, Brown). Remember the acronym **"OMB"**.

## Conclusion

Prisoner classification is the essential management tool that allows correctional agencies to safely and efficiently manage a large and heterogeneous inmate population. It is a dynamic process that aims to match the right inmate to the right security level and the right rehabilitation program. By separating inmates based on the risk they pose, the system protects both the public and the inmates themselves. By identifying their individual needs, it provides a roadmap for their potential rehabilitation. A sound classification system is the foundation upon which all other aspects of modern, effective prison management are built.

## Introduction

Not all prisoners are the same. They vary widely in terms of the crimes they have committed, their history of violence, their risk of escape, and their rehabilitative needs. To manage a large and diverse inmate population safely and effectively, correctional administrators rely on a process called **Classification**. This is the process of assessing each inmate and assigning them to the appropriate custody and treatment programs. A key outcome of this process is the inmate's assignment to a specific **security level**. This module will explain the purpose of classification and describe the different security levels within a prison system.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Define prisoner classification and state its primary purposes.
- Describe the role of the Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC) in the classification process.
- Identify and describe the four main security levels in the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor).
- Understand the criteria used to determine an inmate's security classification.


## II. The Classification Process

The classification process begins the moment an offender is committed to the correctional system.

### A. The Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC)
- As discussed in Module 10.4, all national prisoners committed to the Bureau of Corrections first pass through the RDC.
- During their stay at the RDC (approx. 60 days), they are subjected to a battery of tests and examinations (medical, psychological, sociological, etc.).
- The purpose of the RDC is to gather all the necessary information to make an initial classification decision.

### B. The Initial Classification
- At the end of the diagnostic period, a **Classification Board** or "Staff Conference" is held.
- The board reviews all the information gathered and makes the initial determination of the inmate's:
    1.  **Security Classification** (Maximum, Medium, or Minimum).
    2.  **Rehabilitation Program** (the specific treatment and training plan for the inmate).

### C. Re-classification
- Classification is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process.
- An inmate's security level and program assignment are reviewed periodically (e.g., every 6 months or annually).
- An inmate who demonstrates good behavior and progress in their rehabilitation program can be **re-classified to a lower security level**. Conversely, an inmate who commits serious violations can be moved to a higher security level.


## IV. The Role of the Classification Board

Each prison facility has a Classification Board that is responsible for the re-classification of inmates and for recommending changes to their rehabilitation programs.
- **Composition:** The board is usually chaired by the prison's Deputy Superintendent for Reformation and includes members like the chief medical officer, the chief education officer, and a psychologist.
- **Function:** The board regularly reviews the case of each inmate, considering their disciplinary record, their progress in work and educational programs, and their overall attitude, to determine if a change in their classification is warranted.
