---

### 1. Definition of Dangerous Drugs

Under R.A. 9165, **Dangerous Drugs** are defined as those listed in the Schedules annexed to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and in the Schedules annexed to the 1971 Single Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The term includes any drug that produces a physiological or psychological dependence, as well as any substance that has the capacity to produce a similar effect.

**Key Examples:**
- **Methamphetamine Hydrochloride** (Shabu)
- **Cannabis** (Marijuana)
- **Cocaine** (Cocaine Hydrochloride)
- **MDMA** (Ecstasy)
- **Opium and its derivatives** (Morphine, Heroin)

### 2. Schedules of Dangerous Drugs

R.A. 9165 and the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) classify dangerous drugs into lists or "schedules" based on their potential for abuse, medical utility, and safety standards. These schedules are heavily based on international conventions.

- **Schedule I:** High potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use (e.g., Marijuana, MDMA).
- **Schedule II:** High potential for abuse, but with currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions (e.g., Cocaine, Methamphetamine).
- **Schedule III:** Less potential for abuse than Schedule I & II drugs, with accepted medical use (e.g., Ketamine).
- **Schedule IV:** Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule III drugs (e.g., Diazepam/Valium).
- **Schedule V:** Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule IV drugs (e.g., preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics).

### 3. Key Drug Offenses and Penalties

Penalties under R.A. 9165 are primarily determined by the **type** and **quantity** of the drug involved.

| Offense | Drug & Quantity | Penalty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sale, Trading, Distribution** (Sec. 5) | Any quantity | Life Imprisonment to Death + Fine (₱500k-₱10M) |
| **Possession** (Sec. 11) | **Shabu/Cocaine/Heroin:** 10g or more | Life Imprisonment to Death + Fine (₱500k-₱10M) |
| | **Shabu/Cocaine/Heroin:** 5g to <10g | 20 yrs & 1 day to Life Imprisonment + Fine (₱400k-₱500k) |
| | **Shabu/Cocaine/Heroin:** <5g | 12 yrs & 1 day to 20 yrs + Fine (₱300k-₱400k) |
| | **Marijuana:** 500g or more | Life Imprisonment to Death + Fine (₱500k-₱10M) |
| | **Marijuana:** 300g to <500g | 20 yrs & 1 day to Life Imprisonment + Fine (₱400k-₱500k) |
| | **Marijuana:** <300g | 12 yrs & 1 day to 20 yrs + Fine (₱300k-₱400k) |
| **Use of Dangerous Drugs** (Sec. 15) | First Offense (Positive Drug Test) | Minimum 6 months rehabilitation in a government center |
| | Second Offense | Imprisonment (6 yrs & 1 day to 12 yrs) + Fine (₱50k-₱200k) |

- **Manufacture of Dangerous Drugs** (Sec. 8): Life Imprisonment to Death + Fine (₱500k-₱10M).

### 4. Chain of Custody Requirements (Section 21)

The chain of custody is the **duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs** from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court until destruction. Failure to comply with the procedure is a common cause for the dismissal of drug cases.

**Mandatory Procedure (as amended by R.A. 10640):**
1.  **Immediate Inventory and Photograph:** The seized items must be inventoried and photographed immediately at the place of seizure.
2.  **Presence of Witnesses:** This must be done in the presence of:
    a. The accused or his/her representative or counsel.
    b. An elected public official.
    c. A representative from the National Prosecution Service (NPS) OR the media.
    *(Note: The original R.A. 9165 required both NPS/DOJ and media representatives.)*
3.  **Justifiable Grounds for Exception:** If the inventory cannot be done at the place of seizure, it may be done at the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, provided that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items are preserved. The reason for the deviation must be stated in the police report.

### 5. Buy-Bust Operations

A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment used by law enforcement to catch a person in the act of selling dangerous drugs.

**Elements of a Valid Buy-Bust:**
1.  **The poseur-buyer** who is an officer of the law.
2.  **Marked money** used in the transaction.
3.  **The delivery of the dangerous drug** to the poseur-buyer.
4.  **The payment** with the marked money.
5.  **The arrest** of the seller.

**Entrapment vs. Instigation:**
- **Entrapment (Legal):** The officer merely facilitates the opportunity for a person already intending to commit a crime. The criminal intent originates from the accused.
- **Instigation (Illegal):** The officer actively induces a person to commit a crime that they would not otherwise have committed. The criminal intent originates from the officer. This is a valid defense and absolves the accused.

### 6. PDEA Functions

The **Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA)** is the lead anti-drug law enforcement agency, responsible for the efficient and effective implementation of R.A. 9165.

**Key Functions (Section 84):**
- Implement and enforce the provisions of R.A. 9165.
- Coordinate and supervise all drug enforcement activities of other law enforcement agencies.
- Investigate all persons suspected of violating the Act.
- Arrest and apprehend all violators and seize the effects of the crime.
- Create and maintain a national drug intelligence network.
- Administer the custodial management of all seized dangerous drugs.
- Foster international cooperation in fighting drug trafficking.

### 7. Plea Bargaining in Drug Cases

Following the Supreme Court ruling in *Estipona v. Lobrigo* (2017), plea bargaining is now allowed in certain drug cases. The Court established a specific framework for acceptable plea bargains.

| Offense Charged (Sec) | Quantity | Acceptable Plea Bargain (Sec) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sec. 11 (Possession) | 0.01g to 0.99g shabu | Sec. 12 (Possession of Paraphernalia) |
| Sec. 11 (Possession) | 5g to 9.99g shabu | Sec. 11 (Possession of <5g) |
| Sec. 11 (Possession) | 300g to 499g marijuana | Sec. 11 (Possession of <300g) |
| Sec. 5 (Sale) | 0.01g to 0.99g shabu | Sec. 12 (Possession of Paraphernalia) |

*Note: Plea bargaining is not allowed for the sale of 1.00 gram or more of shabu/marijuana, or for possession of 10 grams or more of shabu. This framework is subject to changes by the Supreme Court.*
