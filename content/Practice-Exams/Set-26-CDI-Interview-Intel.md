title: 'Practice Exam: Crime Detection & Investigation - Interview & Intelligence (Set 26)'
description: 'A 30-question practice exam covering interview techniques, interrogation methods, police intelligence, and surveillance operations.'
---

### 1. Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of an interview in a criminal investigation?

- [ ] To obtain a confession from a suspect.
- [x] To gather information from a person who has knowledge of the facts of a crime.
- [ ] To determine the guilt or innocence of a person.
- [ ] To induce a person to make admissions.

> **Explanation:** An interview is an information-gathering process. Its main goal is to obtain facts and details from witnesses, victims, or other individuals who might have information relevant to the case. Interrogation, on the other hand, is specifically aimed at obtaining a confession or admission from a suspect.

### 2. What is the fundamental difference between an interview and an interrogation?

- [ ] An interview is accusatory, while an interrogation is non-accusatory.
- [x] An interview is non-accusatory and seeks information, while an interrogation is accusatory and aims to get a confession.
- [ ] The location where they are conducted is the only difference.
- [ ] An interview is only for witnesses, while an interrogation is only for suspects.

> **Explanation:** The key distinction lies in the nature and purpose. An interview is a non-accusatory, formal conversation to gather information. An interrogation is accusatory in nature, designed to elicit a confession from a suspect believed to be guilty.

### 3. Under Philippine law, when does an investigatory process begin to be considered a "custodial investigation"?

- [ ] The moment a person is invited to the police station.
- [ ] When the investigator starts asking questions.
- [x] When the investigation is no longer a general inquiry and has focused on a particular suspect who has been taken into custody.
- [ ] When a complaint is formally filed with the prosecutor's office.

> **Explanation:** The Supreme Court of the Philippines has defined custodial investigation as the point where the investigation ceases to be a general inquiry into an unsolved crime and begins to focus on a particular suspect in police custody, who is then interrogated. This is the trigger for the Miranda rights under R.A. 7438.

### 4. An investigator using the "alternating blame" technique during an interrogation is applying what psychological principle?

- [ ] Shifting the blame entirely to a third party.
- [x] Offering the suspect two contrasting motives for the crime, one being more socially acceptable than the other.
- [ ] Blaming the victim for the commission of the crime.
- [ ] Blaming the suspect's accomplice to create conflict.

> **Explanation:** The alternating blame technique, a part of the Reid Technique, involves presenting two possible motives for the crime. One motive is presented as heinous and morally reprehensible, while the other is portrayed as understandable or excusable. The goal is to make the suspect choose the more acceptable reason, thereby admitting guilt.

### 5. What is the primary purpose of the "Cognitive Interview" technique?

- [ ] To pressure a suspect into a confession.
- [ ] To assess a suspect's mental state.
- [x] To enhance memory recall in cooperative witnesses and victims.
- [ ] To detect deception in a subject's statement.

> **Explanation:** The Cognitive Interview is a method designed to help witnesses and victims remember more information about an event. It uses principles of memory retrieval, such as context reinstatement and recalling events in different orders, to maximize the quantity and quality of information gathered. It is not designed for interrogation.

### 6. According to the Reid Technique, what is the first and most direct step in the interrogation process?

- [ ] Developing a theme.
- [x] The direct, positive confrontation.
- [ ] Handling denials.
- [ ] Overcoming objections.

> **Explanation:** The Reid Technique consists of nine steps. The very first step is the direct, positive confrontation, where the investigator confidently states that the suspect is responsible for the crime. This is designed to put the suspect on the defensive from the outset.

### 7. R.A. 7438, which defines the rights of persons under custodial investigation, is an enhancement of which constitutional right?

- [ ] The right to bail.
- [x] The Miranda Rights.
- [ ] The right to a speedy trial.
- [ ] The right against unreasonable searches and seizures.

> **Explanation:** Republic Act No. 7438 is the specific law that operationalizes and expands upon the Miranda rights as enshrined in the Philippine Constitution. It details the duties of the arresting officer, the rights of the accused (including the right to counsel of their choice), and the penalties for violations.

### 8. An investigator asks a witness to "report everything, even things you think are unimportant." Which instruction of the Cognitive Interview is being used?

- [ ] Context Reinstatement.
- [ ] Change Perspective.
- [x] Report Everything.
- [ ] Reverse Order.

> **Explanation:** The "Report Everything" instruction encourages the witness to provide every detail they can remember, no matter how trivial it may seem. This is based on the principle that small, seemingly irrelevant details can trigger more significant memories or be pieced together by the investigator to form a clearer picture.

### 9. A police intelligence report is graded "A-1". What does this grading signify?

- [ ] The information is confirmed by other sources and the source is completely reliable.
- [x] The information is confirmed by other sources and the source is usually reliable.
- [ ] The information is probably true and the source is fairly reliable.
- [ ] The information is of doubtful reliability.

> **Explanation:** The evaluation of intelligence uses a two-character code. The letter (A-F) represents the reliability of the information, and the number (1-6) represents the reliability of the source. 'A' means the information is confirmed, and '1' means the source is completely reliable. The standard format is Source Reliability then Information Accuracy (e.g., 1A), but the A-1 format is also used to denote the highest level of confidence. However, in standard PNP evaluation, it's Accuracy of Information (Letter) and Reliability of Source (Number). "A" for Confirmed information, and "1" for a Completely Reliable source.

### 10. This type of surveillance is also known as "casing" or "reconnaissance."

- [ ] Moving surveillance.
- [x] Fixed surveillance.
- [ ] Technical surveillance.
- [ ] Undercover surveillance.

> **Explanation:** Fixed surveillance, or a "stakeout," involves observing a specific location or person from a stationary position. It is often used to gather information about a subject's habits, associates, or activities at a particular place, which is essential for planning future operations (casing/reconnaissance).

### 11. An informant provides information to the police for financial payment. What is the classification of this informant?

- [ ] Incidental Informant.
- [x] Mercenary Informant.
- [ ] Voluntary Informant.
- [ ] Repentant Informant.

> **Explanation:** A mercenary informant is motivated by material gain, providing information in exchange for money or other rewards. This is one of the most common types of informants but requires careful management due to their primary motivation.

### 12. In the intelligence cycle, what is the process of converting raw information into a usable form?

- [ ] Collection.
- [x] Processing.
- [ ] Analysis.
- [ ] Dissemination.

> **Explanation:** Processing is the step in the intelligence cycle where collected raw information is transformed into a form that can be readily understood, analyzed, and used by intelligence analysts. This includes decryption, translation, and data organization.

### 13. Which of the following is NOT a right of a person under custodial investigation as per R.A. 7438?

- [ ] The right to remain silent.
- [ ] The right to a competent and independent counsel, preferably of his own choice.
- [x] The right to a polygraph examination.
- [ ] The right to be informed of these rights.

> **Explanation:** While a polygraph can be used as an investigative tool, it is not a fundamental right guaranteed to a person under custodial investigation. The core rights under R.A. 7438 are the rights to remain silent, to have competent and independent counsel, and to be informed of these rights. Any waiver of these rights must be in writing and in the presence of counsel.

### 14. An undercover officer assigned to a specific area to blend in and gather information without a specific target is on what type of assignment?

- [ ] A penetration operation.
- [x] A social assignment.
- [ ] A work assignment.
- [ ] A buy-bust operation.

> **Explanation:** A social assignment involves the undercover officer frequenting places where the criminal elements hang out, such as bars, clubs, or parks, to become a familiar face and gather general intelligence over a period. They are not immediately targeting a specific person but are building a cover story and network.

### 15. An investigator is using the Reid Technique and is now handling the suspect's initial denials. What is the recommended approach for this step?

- [ ] Allow the suspect to deny repeatedly to show their desperation.
- [x] Discourage the suspect from repeating denials by interjecting and redirecting the conversation.
- [ ] Argue with the suspect about their denials.
- [ ] Immediately stop the interrogation if the suspect denies involvement.

> **Explanation:** The Reid Technique advises against letting the suspect dominate the conversation with denials. The investigator should handle denials by interrupting them, transitioning to the theme, and not allowing the suspect to gain a psychological advantage by repeatedly proclaiming innocence.

### 16. What is the primary legal pitfall of using an accomplice as an interrogator for the suspect?

- [ ] It is always ineffective.
- [x] The accomplice may be seen as a person in authority, and any confession obtained through their inducement could be deemed involuntary.
- [ ] It violates the suspect's right to privacy.
- [ ] It constitutes entrapment.

> **Explanation:** Using an accomplice to induce a confession can be legally perilous. If the accomplice's actions are directed by the police, they can be considered an agent of the state. Any promise of leniency or threat made by the accomplice could render the subsequent confession inadmissible, as it was not made voluntarily.

### 17. An investigator asks a witness to recall an event in a different sequence, such as from the end to the beginning. This is an example of which Cognitive Interview technique?

- [ ] Context Reinstatement.
- [ ] Report Everything.
- [x] Reverse Order.
- [ ] Change Perspective.

> **Explanation:** The Reverse Order technique involves asking the witness to describe the event in reverse chronological order. This method helps to access memories that might be missed with a linear recall and can help verify the accuracy of the statement, as it is difficult to fabricate a story backward.

### 18. "A-2" is the intelligence evaluation of a piece of information. This means the information is:

- [ ] Confirmed from other sources and from a source who is usually reliable.
- [x] Probably true and from a source who is usually reliable.
- [ ] Possibly true and from a fairly reliable source.
- [ ] Confirmed and from a fairly reliable source.

> **Explanation:** In the standard evaluation system, the letter refers to the accuracy of the information and the number to the reliability of the source. 'A' is confirmed, 'B' is probably true, 'C' is possibly true. '1' is a completely reliable source, '2' is a usually reliable source. Therefore, A-2 means the information is Confirmed (A) and the source is Usually Reliable (2).

### 19. A police officer is conducting surveillance on a moving subject using a vehicle. What is the "leapfrog" method?

- [ ] One surveillance vehicle follows the subject continuously.
- [x] Several surveillance vehicles take turns following the subject, periodically changing the lead car.
- [ ] The surveillance vehicle drives past the subject and observes from a stationary point ahead.
- [ ] The subject is followed on foot and by vehicle simultaneously.

> **Explanation:** The leapfrog method is a technique in moving surveillance where multiple surveillance units (vehicles or foot patrols) alternate the primary follow position. This minimizes the risk of the subject detecting the same follower over a long period.

### 20. What is the legal requirement for a valid waiver of Miranda rights in the Philippines?

- [ ] It must be made verbally in front of the desk officer.
- [ ] It can be made by the suspect's family member on their behalf.
- [x] It must be in writing and signed by the person in the presence of his counsel.
- [ ] It must be made before a judge.

> **Explanation:** Section 2(d) of R.A. 7438 explicitly states that any waiver of the right to counsel under custodial investigation "must be in writing and signed by such person in the presence of his counsel," otherwise, the waiver is void. This is a strict requirement to prevent coerced or uninformed waivers.

### 21. Which part of the Reid Technique involves minimizing the suspect's perception of the moral seriousness of the crime?

- [ ] The confrontation.
- [x] Theme development.
- [ ] Overcoming objections.
- [ ] Procuring and addressing the details of the crime.

> **Explanation:** Theme development is the heart of the Reid Technique. The interrogator creates a "story" or theme that provides moral or psychological excuses for the suspect's actions (e.g., "it was an accident," "you were under pressure"). This is designed to make it easier for the suspect to confess by reducing their feelings of guilt.

### 22. What is the main objective of police intelligence?

- [ ] To prosecute criminals.
- [ ] To make arrests.
- [x] To produce timely and relevant information for decision-making.
- [ ] To conduct surveillance on all citizens.

> **Explanation:** The ultimate purpose of police intelligence is to provide decision-makers (from patrol officers to chief of police) with the necessary information to make informed and effective decisions regarding crime prevention, law enforcement operations, and resource allocation.

### 23. An informant who provides information to eliminate competition is known as what type of informant?

- [ ] Mercenary Informant.
- [x] Rivalry-motivated Informant.
- [ ] Repentant Informant.
- [ ] Incidental Informant.

> **Explanation:** This type of informant is motivated by a desire to get rid of their rivals, whether in the criminal underworld or in business. Their information may be accurate but is self-serving and needs to be carefully vetted.

### 24. A team of investigators uses various electronic means, such as GPS tracking and wiretapping, to monitor a suspect. What type of surveillance is this?

- [ ] Fixed Surveillance.
- [ ] Moving Surveillance.
- [x] Technical Surveillance.
- [ ] Loose Surveillance.

> **Explanation:** Technical surveillance involves the use of electronic devices and scientific equipment to gather information. This includes wiretaps, GPS trackers, hidden cameras, and other forms of electronic monitoring, which often require legal authorization (e.g., R.A. 4200, the Anti-Wiretapping Act).

### 25. An investigator asks a witness to try and recall the scene of the crime from the perspective of another person who was present. Which Cognitive Interview component is being applied?

- [ ] Context Reinstatement.
- [ ] Report Everything.
- [ ] Reverse Order.
- [x] Change Perspective.

> **Explanation:** The Change Perspective technique instructs the witness to recall the incident from the viewpoint of others who were there or from a different physical perspective. This can unlock new details by breaking the witness out of their standard, often-rehearsed, point of view.

### 26. Which of the following is a key characteristic of an effective interview?

- [ ] The investigator dominates the conversation.
- [ ] It is conducted in a formal, intimidating setting.
- [x] The investigator establishes a rapport with the subject.
- [ ] It is focused on obtaining a signed statement at all costs.

> **Explanation:** Establishing rapport is crucial for a successful interview. When the subject feels comfortable and trusts the interviewer, they are more likely to be cooperative and provide complete and accurate information. A good interviewer is an active listener who creates a non-threatening atmosphere.

### 27. The final step in the intelligence cycle is the:

- [ ] Processing of information.
- [ ] Collection of information.
- [x] Dissemination and use.
- [ ] Evaluation and analysis.

> **Explanation:** The intelligence cycle concludes with the dissemination of the finished intelligence product to the end-users who need it for their decision-making process. The value of intelligence is lost if it is not communicated to the right people at the right time.

### 28. What is the primary risk of a "buy-bust" operation?

- [ ] Loss of evidence.
- [ ] Financial cost.
- [x] High potential for violence and danger to the undercover officer.
- [ ] The possibility of the suspect escaping.

> **Explanation:** A buy-bust is one of the most dangerous undercover assignments. The point of transaction is a moment of high tension and vulnerability for the officer, who is often dealing directly with dangerous and unpredictable criminals. The risk of the operation turning violent is significant.

### 29. A confession obtained in violation of R.A. 7438 is considered:

- [ ] Admissible if the suspect is guilty.
- [ ] Admissible with a judge's discretion.
- [x] Inadmissible in evidence.
- [ ] Admissible, but the officer will be sanctioned.

> **Explanation:** Any confession, admission, or statement obtained in violation of the rights guaranteed under R.A. 7438 (the Miranda rights and the right to counsel) is deemed inadmissible in any proceeding. This is an exclusionary rule designed to deter law enforcement from violating constitutional rights.

### 30. During an interrogation, a suspect who is guilty will most likely:

- [ ] Give broad and non-specific denials.
- [x] Offer weak, qualified, and non-verbal denials.
- [ ] Sit upright and look the interrogator in the eye.
- [ ] Behave calmly and confidently.

> **Explanation:** According to behavioral analysis principles used in interrogation (like the Reid Technique), a guilty suspect's denials are often weak, hesitant, and accompanied by non-verbal cues of deception (e.g., avoiding eye contact, slumped posture, touching face). An innocent person's denials are typically direct, firm, and spontaneous.
