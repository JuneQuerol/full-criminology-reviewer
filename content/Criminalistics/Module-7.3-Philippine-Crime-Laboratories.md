## I. The Philippine National Police (PNP) Forensic Group

The **PNP Forensic Group (FG)**, formerly known as the PNP Crime Laboratory, is the primary operational support unit of the PNP responsible for providing forensic services to all PNP units, as well as to other law enforcement agencies, government entities, and courts upon request.

### A. Mission and History
- **Mission:** To provide timely and accurate scientific and technical support to the PNP and the criminal justice system through forensic examination, research, and training.
- **History:** The first crime laboratory in the Philippines was established in 1945 as a section of the G-2, Military Police Command. This unit evolved over the decades, becoming the PC-INP Crime Laboratory and eventually the PNP Crime Laboratory, now renamed the Forensic Group.

### B. Organizational Structure
The PNP-FG is a national operational support unit with its headquarters in Camp Crame and a network of regional and provincial laboratories.

- **National Headquarters (NHQ):** Houses the most advanced equipment and specialized divisions.
- **Regional Forensic Units (RFUs):** Located in each police region, these labs provide the most common forensic services.
- **Provincial/City Forensic Units (PFUs/CFUs):** Smaller satellite labs that provide basic services like drug testing and initial processing of evidence.

### C. Key Services Offered by the PNP Forensic Group
The PNP-FG is a full-service laboratory offering a wide range of examinations:

1.  **Forensic Chemistry:**
    - Analysis of suspected illegal drugs (RA 9165).
    - Examination for the presence of explosive residues.
    - Paraffin tests for gunshot residue (Note: Paraffin tests are largely considered unreliable and have been replaced by more modern techniques in many countries, but are still sometimes used in the PH).
2.  **Forensic Biology (DNA):**
    - DNA profiling from blood, semen, saliva, and other biological materials for identification and parentage testing.
3.  **Physical Identification:**
    - Fingerprint examination (Dactyloscopy).
    - Composite sketching of suspects.
4.  **Firearms Identification (Ballistics):**
    - Determining if a bullet or cartridge case was fired from a specific firearm.
    - Firearm functionality testing.
5.  **Questioned Documents Examination:**
    - Handwriting analysis, detection of forgeries, and examination of altered documents.
6.  **Medico-Legal (Forensic Medicine):**
    - Conducts autopsies to determine the cause of death.
    - Physical injury examinations of living persons.
    - Alcohol and drug testing on individuals.
7.  **Polygraphy ("Lie Detector" Test):**
    - Conducts polygraph examinations to help investigators verify statements (Note: Polygraph results are not admissible as evidence in Philippine courts but are used as an investigative aid).
8.  **Forensic Photography:**
    - Documents crime scenes and evidence.

## Conclusion

The PNP Forensic Group and the NBI Forensic and Scientific Research Service are the two pillars of forensic science in the Philippines. The PNP-FG provides the broad, day-to-day scientific support needed by the country's primary law enforcement agency. The NBI-FSRS serves as a national specialty center, tackling complex cases and providing an independent forensic voice within the Department of Justice. Together, they ensure that the Philippine criminal justice system has access to the scientific tools necessary to uncover the truth and deliver justice.

## Introduction

In the Philippines, the application of forensic science to criminal investigation is primarily handled by two national government agencies: the **Philippine National Police (PNP) Forensic Group** and the **National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Forensic and Scientific Research Service**. While both perform scientific analysis of physical evidence, they have distinct jurisdictions, histories, and organizational structures. This module will provide an overview of these two key institutions, detailing their functions, services, and roles within the Philippine criminal justice system.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Identify the two main government entities providing forensic services in the Philippines.
- Describe the mission and functions of the PNP Forensic Group.
- Describe the mission and functions of the NBI's forensic divisions.
- Understand the process for requesting forensic examination services from these agencies.
- Differentiate the roles of the PNP and NBI in the context of criminal investigation.


## II. The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Forensic and Scientific Research Service

The NBI is an agency under the Department of Justice (DOJ) that serves as the country's premier investigative agency. Its **Forensic and Scientific Research Service** provides scientific support not only to its own agents but also to other agencies and the public, often handling more complex or high-profile cases.

### A. Mission and Role
- **Mission:** To provide centralized and state-of-the-art forensic services in the Philippines, encompassing both criminal and civil cases.
- **Role:** While the PNP-FG primarily serves the police, the NBI is often seen as a more independent body that can be called upon by the DOJ, the courts, or even private citizens to conduct impartial forensic examinations. They are often requested to provide a "second opinion" on findings from other labs.

### B. Key NBI Forensic Divisions and their Functions

The NBI's forensic services are organized into several specialized divisions:

1.  **Medico-Legal Division:**
    - World-renowned for its expertise in forensic pathology.
    - Conducts autopsies, exhumations, and examinations of skeletal remains. A significant part of their work involves identifying victims of mass disasters.
2.  **Questioned Documents Division:**
    - Examines handwriting, signatures, and all types of documents to detect forgery, alterations, and insertions.
3.  **Dactyloscopy Division (Fingerprints):**
    - Maintains the national criminal fingerprint database for the Philippines.
    - Processes and identifies latent prints from crime scenes.
4.  **Forensic Chemistry Division:**
    - Analyzes narcotics, explosives, and other chemical substances.
5.  **Firearms Investigation Division (FAID):**
    - Handles firearms identification and ballistics examinations.
6.  **Forensic Photography and Publication Division:**
    - Provides photographic documentation and prepares visual aids for court presentations.

| **Parent Agency** | Philippine National Police (under DILG) | National Bureau of Investigation (under DOJ) |
| **Primary Client** | PNP units nationwide. | NBI agents, DOJ, Courts, other agencies, the public. |
| **Jurisdiction** | Primarily criminal cases investigated by the PNP. | Criminal and civil cases; often high-profile, complex, or cases requiring an independent examination. |
| **Scope** | Nationwide network with regional and provincial labs. | Primarily centralized in Manila, though they can deploy teams nationwide. |
| **Medico-Legal** | Performs autopsies, often called "SOCO Medico-Legal." | Highly specialized in forensic pathology and mass disaster victim identification. |
| **Fingerprints** | Maintains its own fingerprint database for cases it handles. | Custodian of the national criminal fingerprint database. |

### The Process of Requesting Examination
1.  **Formal Request:** An investigating agency or a court must submit a formal written request to the crime laboratory.
2.  **Submission of Evidence:** The evidence must be properly collected, marked, and transported to the laboratory, following strict **Chain of Custody** procedures.
3.  **Laboratory Examination:** The appropriate division of the lab analyzes the evidence.
4.  **Issuance of Report:** The laboratory issues a formal, written report of its findings (e.g., Chemistry Report, Ballistics Report).
5.  **Court Testimony:** The examiner who conducted the analysis may be called to testify in court as an expert witness.
