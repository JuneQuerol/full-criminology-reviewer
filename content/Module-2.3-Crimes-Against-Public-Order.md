# Module 2.3: Crimes Against Public Order

## 1. Learning Objectives

*   Understand the legal definitions and elements of key crimes against public order, including rebellion, sedition, assault, and illegal assemblies.
*   Differentiate between related offenses such as rebellion, sedition, and coup d'etat, and identify their specific political motivations and purposes.
*   Identify the persons criminally liable for these offenses, including public officers and private individuals, and understand the concept of "persons in authority" and their agents.
*   Analyze the "absorption doctrine" (Hernandez doctrine) and its application in cases of rebellion, where common crimes are absorbed into the primary political offense.
*   Apply knowledge to practical scenarios through multiple-choice questions, preparing for the Criminology Licensure Exam.

## 2. REBELLION, SEDITION, AND RELATED OFFENSES (Art. 134-142)

### A. REBELLION OR INSURRECTION (Art. 134)

*   **Definition and Purpose:** Rebellion or insurrection is committed by rising publicly and taking arms against the Government for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to said Government or its laws, the territory of the Philippine Islands or any part thereof, of any body of land, naval or other armed forces, or of depriving the Chief Executive or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives. The core of this crime is its **political motivation**—to overthrow the existing government or subvert its authority.

*   **Elements:**
    1.  That there be a public uprising and taking of arms against the Government.
    2.  That the purpose of the uprising is either:
        *   To remove allegiance to the Government or its laws from a part of Philippine territory or a body of armed forces.
        *   To deprive the President or Congress of their powers.

*   **Absorption Doctrine (Hernandez Doctrine):** Established in *People v. Hernandez*, this doctrine states that common crimes like murder, arson, and robbery, when committed in furtherance of rebellion, are absorbed into the single crime of rebellion. The political nature of the offense is paramount, and it cannot be broken down into separate common crimes.

*   **Penalty:** The leader of a rebellion shall suffer the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*. Any person who promotes, maintains, or heads a rebellion shall suffer the penalty of *reclusion temporal*. Any person who participates or executes the commands of others in a rebellion shall suffer the penalty of *prision mayor*.

### B. CONSPIRACY AND PROPOSAL TO COMMIT REBELLION (Art. 136)

*   **Conspiracy:** When two or more persons come to an agreement to rise publicly and take arms against the Government for the purposes of rebellion and decide to commit it.
*   **Proposal:** When a person who has decided to commit rebellion proposes its execution to some other person or persons.
*   **Note:** Both conspiracy and proposal to commit rebellion are punishable, which is an exception to the general rule that conspiracy and proposal are not punishable unless the law specifically provides a penalty therefor.

### C. DISLOYALTY OF PUBLIC OFFICERS (Art. 137)

*   This crime is committed by public officers or employees who, by failing to resist a rebellion or by discharging their duties in a manner that favors the rebels, show disloyalty to the government.

### D. INCITING TO REBELLION (Art. 138)

*   This crime is committed by any person who, without taking arms or being in open hostility against the Government, shall incite others to the execution of any of the acts of rebellion, by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, emblems, banners or other representations tending to the same end.

### E. SEDITION (Art. 139)

*   **Definition:** Sedition is the raising of a commotion or disturbance in the State. It is committed by persons who rise publicly and tumultuously in order to attain by force, intimidation, or by other means outside of legal methods, any of the objectives listed below.

*   **Distinction from Rebellion:**
    *   **Purpose:** Rebellion seeks to overthrow the government. Sedition aims to disrupt public order or prevent the government from functioning freely, but without the intent of overthrowing it.
    *   **Nature:** Rebellion is a crime against national security. Sedition is a crime against public order.

*   **Five Purposes of Sedition:**
    1.  To prevent the promulgation or execution of any law or the holding of any popular election.
    2.  To prevent the National Government, or any provincial or municipal government, from freely exercising its functions.
    3.  To inflict any act of hate or revenge upon the person or property of any public officer or employee.
    4.  To commit, for any political or social end, any act of hate or revenge against private persons or any social class.
    5.  To despoil, for any political or social end, any person, municipality or province, or the National Government of all its property or any part thereof.

### F. CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SEDITION (Art. 141)

*   This is committed when two or more persons come to an agreement to commit sedition and decide to commit it.

### G. INCITING TO SEDITION (Art. 142)

*   This is committed by any person who, without taking any direct part in the crime of sedition, should incite others to the accomplishment of any of the acts which constitute sedition, by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, emblems, etc.

## 3. CRIMES AGAINST POPULAR REPRESENTATION (Art. 143-145)

### A. Acts tending to prevent the meeting of the National Assembly and similar bodies (Art. 143)

*   This crime is committed by any person who, by force or fraud, prevents the meeting of Congress or of any of its committees.

### B. Disturbance of proceedings (Art. 144)

*   This is committed by any person who disturbs the meetings of Congress or who behaves in such a manner as to interrupt its proceedings or to impair the respect due it.

### C. Violation of parliamentary immunity (Art. 145)

*   This crime is committed by any person who shall use force, intimidation, threats, or fraud to prevent any member of Congress from attending the meetings, from expressing his opinions or casting his vote.

## 4. ILLEGAL ASSEMBLIES AND ASSOCIATIONS (Art. 146-147)

*   **Illegal Assembly (Art. 146):** A meeting of a group of people for the purpose of committing any of the crimes punishable under the Revised Penal Code, or a meeting where the audience is incited to the commission of treason, rebellion, sedition, or assault.
*   **Illegal Association (Art. 147):** An association totally or partially organized for the purpose of committing any of the crimes punishable under the RPC or for some purpose contrary to public morals.

## 5. DIRECT ASSAULT (Art. 148)

*   **Two Ways of Committing:**
    1.  Without a public uprising, by employing force or intimidation for the attainment of any of the purposes of rebellion and sedition.
    2.  Without a public uprising, by attacking, employing force, or by seriously intimidating or resisting any person in authority or his agent, while engaged in the performance of official duties, or on occasion of such performance.

*   **Elements:**
    *   **First Form:** (1) Offender employs force or intimidation, (2) the aim is to attain any of the purposes of rebellion/sedition, (3) there is no public uprising.
    *   **Second Form:** (1) Offender attacks, uses force, or seriously intimidates/resists, (2) the offended party is a person in authority or his agent, (3) the person in authority or his agent is engaged in the performance of his official duties, or the assault is on occasion of such performance.

*   **Who are Persons in Authority and Agents:**
    *   **Person in Authority:** Any person directly vested with jurisdiction, whether as an individual or as a member of some court or governmental corporation, board, or commission.
    *   **Agent of a Person in Authority:** Any person who, by direct provision of law or by election or by appointment by competent authority, is charged with the maintenance of public order and the protection and security of life and property.

## 6. INDIRECT ASSAULT (Art. 149)

*   This crime is committed by any person who shall make use of force or intimidation upon any person coming to the aid of the authorities or their agents on occasion of the commission of the crimes of direct assault.

## 7. RESISTANCE AND DISOBEDIENCE (Art. 151)

*   This crime is committed by any person who shall resist or seriously disobey any person in authority, or the agents of such person, while engaged in the performance of official duties.
*   **Distinction from Direct Assault:**
    *   In direct assault, there is an attack, use of force, or serious intimidation.
    *   In resistance and disobedience, the force used is not as serious. It is a lesser degree of violence.
