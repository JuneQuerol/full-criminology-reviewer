### 1. In handwriting analysis, what refers to the design of letters that is fundamental to a writing system?

- [ ] Line quality
- [x] System of writing
- [ ] Slant
- [ ] Alignment

> Explanation: The "system of writing" is the combination of basic letter designs and writing movements taught in school. Individual variations from this system form the basis of handwriting identification.

### 2. A forger attempts to replicate a genuine signature while looking at it. This is known as what type of forgery?

- [ ] Traced forgery
- [x] Simulated forgery
- [ ] Freehand forgery
- [ ] Cut-and-paste forgery

> Explanation: Simulated forgery involves a forger trying to copy a known signature by sight, often resulting in slow, hesitating strokes and a lack of natural variation.

### 3. An investigator finds a document where a word was removed using a rubber eraser and then typed over. What is this type of alteration?

- [ ] Interlineation
- [x] Mechanical erasure
- [ ] Chemical erasure
- [ ] Obliteration

> Explanation: Mechanical erasure involves physically abrading the paper surface to remove writing. This action disturbs paper fibers and is often detectable under magnification or with oblique lighting.

### 4. Which of the following is a key identifying characteristic when examining documents produced by a dot-matrix printer?

- [ ] Pitch and font style
- [ ] Ribbon ink condition
- [x] Pin damage and alignment defects
- [ ] Toner-to-paper fusion method

> Explanation: Dot-matrix printers use a print head with small pins. Individual defects in these pins, such as damage or misalignment, create unique and repeatable imperfections in the printed characters, which can be used for identification.

### 5. What is the primary purpose of using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) in ink analysis?

- [ ] To determine the age of the ink
- [x] To separate the chemical components of the ink
- [ ] To measure the thickness of the ink line
- [ ] To identify the brand of the pen

> Explanation: Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) is a standard laboratory technique used to separate the different colored dyes and chemical compounds within an ink sample. This allows forensic chemists to compare the composition of different inks.

### 6. What branch of forensic chemistry deals with the detection and identification of poisonous substances in body fluids, tissues, and organs?

- [ ] Arson investigation
- [x] Forensic toxicology
- [ ] Explosives analysis
- [ ] Serology

> Explanation: Forensic toxicology is the study of the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms, specifically in the context of legal investigations. It focuses on identifying drugs and poisons in human samples to determine their role in a death or crime.

### 7. Under RA 9165, what is the minimum quantity of shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) that qualifies as a non-bailable offense?

- [ ] 10 grams
- [ ] 25 grams
- [x] 50 grams
- [ ] 100 grams

> Explanation: Section 11 of RA 9165 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs) specifies that possession of 50 grams or more of methamphetamine hydrochloride is punishable by life imprisonment and is a non-bailable offense.

### 8. What preliminary field test is commonly used by police officers in the Philippines to screen for the presence of methamphetamine (shabu)?

- [ ] Duquenois-Levine Test
- [x] Marquis Reagent Test
- [ ] Van Urk's Test
- [ ] Kastle-Meyer Test

> Explanation: The Marquis Reagent Test is a colorimetric test used for the presumptive identification of various drugs. It produces a distinct orange to brown color in the presence of amphetamine-type substances like shabu.

### 9. A bloody shirt is found at a crime scene. To preserve the biological evidence for DNA analysis, what is the most critical first step?

- [ ] Immediately place it in a sealed plastic bag.
- [ ] Spray it with a preservative solution.
- [x] Allow it to air-dry completely away from direct sunlight.
- [ ] Freeze the shirt while it is still wet.

> Explanation: Moisture promotes bacterial growth, which can degrade DNA. The proper procedure is to air-dry the bloody item thoroughly before packaging it in a paper bag to prevent moisture buildup and cross-contamination.

### 10. In questioned document examination, what term describes the visible record of the path of a writing instrument on a surface?

- [ ] Pen pressure
- [x] Stroke
- [ ] Diacritic
- [ ] Retrace

> Explanation: A stroke is the fundamental unit of writing, representing a single movement of the pen. The combination, direction, and sequence of strokes form letters and words.

### 11. What type of forgery is created when a forger writes a signature in their own style, with no attempt to copy the genuine model?

- [ ] Simulated forgery
- [ ] Traced forgery
- [x] Simple or Spurious forgery
- [ ] Carbon-outline forgery

> Explanation: A simple (or spurious) forgery is one where the forger does not have a sample of the real signature and writes it in their own handwriting. This is the easiest type of forgery to detect.

### 12. An examiner uses an Electrostatic Detection Apparatus (ESDA) on a document. What is this device primarily used to reveal?

- [ ] Alterations made with different inks
- [x] Indented writing
- [ ] Watermarks on the paper
- [ ] The presence of security fibers

> Explanation: The ESDA is a non-destructive tool that visualizes indented writing (impressions) left on a sheet of paper by the pressure of writing on a page above it.

### 13. Which instrument is used to compare the fine details and individual characteristics of two bullets or cartridge cases side-by-side?

- [ ] Stereoscopic microscope
- [x] Comparison microscope
- [ ] Gas chromatograph
- [ ] Spectrophotometer

> Explanation: While this question borders on ballistics, the comparison microscope is a foundational tool in many areas of criminalistics. It consists of two microscopes linked by an optical bridge, allowing an examiner to view two objects simultaneously in a split-screen, which is also used for comparing typewritten samples or other markings.

### 14. In the analysis of paper, what does the term 'watermark' refer to?

- [ ] A post-production security feature
- [ ] A defect from the manufacturing process
- [x] A design impressed into the paper during manufacture
- [ ] A stain caused by liquid spillage

> Explanation: A watermark is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that is created by variations in thickness while the paper is still wet. It is a key feature for identifying the source and date of paper.

### 15. The confirmatory test for the presence of blood, which involves the formation of salmon-pink rhomboid crystals, is known as:

- [ ] Benzidine Test
- [ ] Phenolphthalein Test (Kastle-Meyer)
- [x] Teichmann Test (Hematin Crystal Test)
- [ ] Luminol Test

> Explanation: The Teichmann test is a microcrystal test where a suspected bloodstain, when heated with glacial acetic acid and a salt, forms characteristic hematin chloride crystals, confirming the presence of hemoglobin.

### 16. What is the main objective of chain of custody in the handling of physical evidence?

- [ ] To demonstrate the evidence is relevant to the case.
- [x] To account for the life of the evidence from collection to court presentation.
- [ ] To prevent unauthorized personnel from viewing the evidence.
- [ ] To ensure the evidence is properly labeled with the case number.

> Explanation: Chain of custody is the chronological documentation of the seizure, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence. An unbroken chain is essential to prove the integrity of the evidence and that it has not been tampered with.

### 17. A suspect is believed to have fired a gun recently. Which chemical test is used to detect nitrite residues (from gunpowder) on their hands?

- [ ] Takayama Test
- [ ] Acid Phosphatase Test
- [x] Diphenylamine Test (Paraffin Test)
- [ ] Florence Test

> Explanation: The Diphenylamine test, also known as the Paraffin test, uses diphenylamine reagent to detect the presence of nitrates and nitrites, which are components of gunpowder residue. A positive result is indicated by a blue color.

### 18. According to RA 9165, which government agency is designated as the primary body for the custody and disposition of seized dangerous drugs?

- [ ] Philippine National Police (PNP)
- [x] Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA)
- [ ] National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)
- [ ] Department of Health (DOH)

> Explanation: RA 9165 mandates that the PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs seized, confiscated, or surrendered, for proper disposition.

### 19. What is the phenomenon of a typewriter producing letters that are not perfectly aligned on the baseline?

- [ ] Transitory defect
- [x] Alignment defect
- [ ] Permanent defect
- [ ] Typeface mismatch

> Explanation: An alignment defect refers to the improper orientation of a character as it strikes the paper, being either off its feet (uneven impression) or vertically misaligned with other characters. These defects can be unique to a specific machine.

### 20. Handwriting feature that refers to the average force used in writing, as evidenced by the width and darkness of the strokes.

- [x] Pen pressure
- [ ] Pen lift
- [ ] Shading
- [ ] Rhythm

> Explanation: Pen pressure is the physical force exerted on the writing instrument. It is a significant individual characteristic, observable in the thickness of strokes (especially on upstrokes and downstrokes) and the indentation left on the paper.

### 21. Which of the following is considered a 'class characteristic' of a manufactured product like paper or ink?

- [ ] A unique tear pattern on a piece of paper.
- [x] The general chemical formula of a specific brand of ink.
- [ ] A random bubble defect in a sheet of glass.
- [ ] A specific striation mark on a tool.

> Explanation: Class characteristics are properties of evidence that can only be associated with a group and never with a single source. The general formula for an ink brand is a class characteristic, whereas a unique defect or mark is an individual characteristic.

### 22. The process of making a document appear older than it actually is, is known as:

- [ ] Anachronism
- [x] Artificial aging
- [ ] Restoration
- [ ] Document charring

> Explanation: Artificial aging is the fraudulent process of treating a document to make it look old. This can be done through chemical treatment, exposure to heat, or physical manipulation to simulate wear and tear.

### 23. What is the primary active component in marijuana that is tested for in forensic toxicology?

- [ ] Cannabidiol (CBD)
- [ ] Morphine
- [x] Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
- [ ] Codeine

> Explanation: THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Forensic tests for marijuana use are designed to detect THC and its metabolites in blood, urine, or hair.

### 24. At a suspected arson scene, where is the best place to collect samples for accelerant testing?

- [ ] At the highest point of the charred area.
- [ ] From any ashes found in the center of the room.
- [x] At the point of origin, from porous materials and soil.
- [ ] From the ceiling directly above the fire.

> Explanation: Accelerants are volatile liquids that will seep downwards. The point of origin and porous materials (like carpet, wood, or soil) are the most likely places to retain traces of the accelerant for laboratory analysis. Samples should be sealed in an airtight container like a metal can.

### 25. An alteration on a document where the original writing is covered with an opaque material to block it from view is called:

- [ ] Erasure
- [x] Obliteration
- [ ] Addition
- [ ] Insertion

> Explanation: Obliteration is the act of obscuring or blotting out original writing by covering it with a substance like correction fluid, thick ink, or another material to make it unreadable.

### 26. When collecting a suspect's handwriting standards (exemplars), what is the most important consideration?

- [ ] The writing should be done on the same day.
- [x] The exemplars should be comparable to the questioned text (e.g., cursive to cursive).
- [ ] The suspect should be allowed to copy the questioned document directly.
- [ ] The writing should be done with the same brand of pen.

> Explanation: The most critical rule is to obtain comparable samples. The writing style (cursive, print), letters, and words in the exemplar must be similar to those in the questioned document for a meaningful comparison.

### 27. What is the term for writing that shows a lack of fluency, appearing jerky and slow, which is often a sign of forgery or disguise?

- [ ] Rhythmic writing
- [ ] Spontaneous writing
- [x] Hesitation
- [ ] Tremor

> Explanation: Hesitation is characterized by an unnatural, start-and-stop quality in the writing line. It indicates that the writer is either carefully drawing the letters (as in forgery) or attempting to alter their natural writing style.

### 28. A confirmatory test for semen, which looks for the presence of the p30 protein or Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), is the:

- [ ] Barberio's Test
- [x] PSA Test (p30 Test)
- [ ] Florence Test
- [ ] Acid Phosphatase Test

> Explanation: The Acid Phosphatase (AP) test is a presumptive test for semen. The confirmatory test involves identifying the p30 protein (Prostate Specific Antigen), which is unique to seminal fluid, or observing spermatozoa under a microscope.

### 29. A document is suspected of being a forgery because the signature appears too perfect and identical to another known genuine signature. This suggests what type of forgery?

- [x] Traced forgery
- [ ] Freehand forgery
- [ ] Simulated forgery
- [ ] Spurious forgery

> Explanation: Genuine signatures always contain natural variation. Signatures that are perfectly identical, or 'deadly similar,' are strong indicators of tracing, as no one can sign their name exactly the same way twice.

### 30. During a crime scene search for chemical evidence, which item is LEAST likely to be of interest for toxicological or chemical analysis?

- [ ] A half-empty bottle of prescription pills.
- [ ] A syringe found near the victim.
- [ ] A stained piece of carpet that smells of gasoline.
- [x] A printed email found on the victim's desk.

> Explanation: While the email might be evidence for other aspects of the investigation, it is not physical-chemical evidence. The pills, syringe, and stained carpet are all items that can be directly analyzed by a forensic chemist to identify drugs, poisons, or accelerants.
