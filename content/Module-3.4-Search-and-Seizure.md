## 1. Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the constitutional and procedural basis of search and seizure in the Philippines.
- Identify the requisites for the issuance of a valid search warrant.
- Differentiate between a valid search warrant and a general warrant.

## 2. CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS

### Article III, Section 2, 1987 Constitution

"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized."

### Right against unreasonable searches and seizures

This is a fundamental right that protects the privacy and sanctity of the person, home, and belongings from arbitrary intrusions by the State. It is a personal right that can be waived only by the individual whose rights are invaded, not by one who is not a real party in interest.

### Exclusionary rule (fruit of the poisonous tree)

Any evidence obtained in violation of this right is inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding. This is known as the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine.

## 3. SEARCH WARRANT (Rule 126)

### A. DEFINITION

A search warrant is an order in writing issued in the name of the People of the Philippines, signed by a judge and directed to a peace officer, commanding him to search for personal property described therein and bring it before the court.

### B. REQUISITES FOR ISSUANCE

1.  **Probable cause:** There must be a probable cause in connection with one specific offense.
2.  **Determined personally by the judge:** The probable cause must be personally determined by the judge.
3.  **Examination under oath:** The determination must be made after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce.
4.  **Particular description of place and things:** The warrant must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

### C. PROBABLE CAUSE

-   **Definition:** Such facts and circumstances which would lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed and that the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the place sought to be searched.
-   **How determined:** By the judge, after personally examining the complainant and witnesses. The examination must be in the form of searching questions and answers, in writing and under oath.
-   **Personal examination by judge:** The judge must not simply rely on the affidavits of the complainant and witnesses. He must personally examine them.

### D. PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT

-   **Place to be searched:** The description of the place must be so particular that the officer with the warrant can, with reasonable effort, ascertain and identify the place intended.
-   **Things to be seized:** The description of the things to be seized must be so particular that the officer is left with no discretion as to what articles he shall seize.
-   **General warrants (void):** A warrant that does not particularly describe the things to be seized is a general warrant and is void.

### E. VALIDITY OF SEARCH WARRANT

-   **10 days from issuance:** A search warrant shall be valid for 10 days from its date. Thereafter, it shall be void.
-   **Time of search (daytime rule, exceptions):** The warrant must direct that it be served in the day time, unless the affidavit asserts that the property is on the person or in the place ordered to be searched, in which case a direction may be inserted that it be served at any time of the day or night.

### F. PERSONAL PROPERTY TO BE SEIZED

-   Subject of the offense;
-   Stolen or embezzled and other proceeds, or fruits of the offense; or
-   Used or intended to be used as the means of committing an offense.
-   Possessed in violation of law (e.g. illegal drugs, unlicensed firearms).

## 4. WARRANTLESS SEARCHES (VALID EXCEPTIONS)

### A. Search incidental to lawful arrest

A person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may have been used or constitute proof in the commission of an offense without a search warrant. The search must be contemporaneous to the arrest and within the immediate control of the person arrested.

### B. Plain view doctrine

Objects falling in the "plain view" of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be presented as evidence.

### C. Search of moving vehicle

A moving vehicle can be searched without a warrant because the need to search is immediate and it is not practicable to secure a warrant.

### D. Consented search (waiver)

A person may voluntarily waive his right against unreasonable searches. The consent must be unequivocal, specific, and intelligently given, uncontaminated by any duress or coercion.

### E. Customs search

Searches of persons and baggage at customs are allowed without a warrant, as part of the sovereign's power to regulate the entry of persons and goods.

### F. Stop and frisk (Terry search)

A police officer may stop a person for the purpose of investigating a possible criminal behavior, and may conduct a limited search for weapons if he has reason to believe that the person is armed and dangerous.

### G. Emergency/exigent circumstances

In cases of emergency, where there is a compelling reason to believe that a crime is being committed and there is no time to secure a warrant, a warrantless search may be justified.

### H. Airport/seaport searches

Routine security checks at airports and seaports are allowed without a warrant.

### I. Checkpoint searches (limited)

Routine checkpoint searches are allowed as long as they are conducted in a way that is least intrusive to the public.

## 5. PROCEDURE IN SERVING SEARCH WARRANT

-   **Officer must give copy:** The officer must give a detailed receipt for the property seized to the lawful occupant of the premises, or in his absence, in the presence of at least two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality.
-   **Receipt for property seized:** The officer must also leave a receipt for the property seized in the place in which he found the seized property.
-   **Inventory in presence of witnesses:** The officer must make an accurate inventory of the property seized in the presence of the occupant of the house and at least two witnesses.
-   **Return to court:** The officer must forthwith deliver the property seized to the judge who issued the warrant, together with a true inventory thereof duly verified under oath.

## 6. EXCLUSIONARY RULE

-   **Inadmissibility of illegally obtained evidence:** Evidence obtained through an illegal search and seizure is inadmissible in any proceeding.
-   **Exceptions:** The rule does not apply if the evidence was obtained by a private individual acting on his own, or if the evidence would have been inevitably discovered by legal means.
-   **Fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine:** Any evidence derived from an illegal search is also inadmissible.

## 7. KNOCK AND ANNOUNCE RULE

The officer, if refused admittance to the place of directed search after giving notice of his purpose and authority, may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house or any part of a house or anything therein to execute the warrant or liberate himself or any person lawfully aiding him when unlawfully detained therein.

## 8. Comparison Table: Search with Warrant vs Warrantless Search

| Feature                 | Search with Warrant                                 | Warrantless Search                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basis**               | A valid search warrant issued by a judge            | One of the recognized exceptions to the warrant rule    |
| **Probable Cause**      | Determined by a judge after examination of evidence | Determined by the police officer on the spot            |
| **Scope of Search**     | Limited to the place and things described in the warrant | Limited by the nature of the exception (e.g., area of immediate control) |
| **Presumption of Validity** | Presumed valid                                      | Presumed invalid; burden on the state to prove its legality |

## 9. Important Jurisprudence on Search and Seizure

-   **People v. Marti:** The constitutional proscription against unlawful searches and seizures applies only to government actions, not to the acts of private individuals.
-   **People v. Cogaed:** A waiver of an illegal warrantless search must be unequivocal, specific, and intelligently given. Mere passive conformity is not enough.
-   **People v. Aruta:** A checkpoint search must be limited to a visual inspection. Extensive searches are permissible only if the officers have probable cause to believe that the motorist is a law offender.
-   **Dizon v. CTA:** A corporation's right to privacy is not absolute and may be limited by the state's power to tax.
-   **Malacat v. CA:** "Stop and frisk" searches are limited to a protective search of the outer clothing for weapons.
