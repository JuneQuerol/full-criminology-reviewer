# Module 7.8: Handwriting & Typewriting Analysis

## Introduction

Beyond the detection of forgery, the core of questioned document examination often involves determining the **authorship** of handwriting or the **source** of a typewritten document. Handwriting analysis is based on the principle that every person's handwriting is unique. Similarly, typewriting analysis is based on the fact that, like any machine, a typewriter can acquire unique defects that are transferred to the paper. This module delves into the specifics of handwriting identification and the forensic examination of typewritten documents.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Understand the basis for handwriting identification.
- Differentiate between class and individual characteristics in handwriting.
- Identify various handwriting characteristics used for comparison.
- Explain how a typewriter can be identified as the source of a document.
- Distinguish between defects in typewriters and printers.

## I. Handwriting Identification and Comparison

The fundamental principle of handwriting analysis is that **no two people write exactly alike**. This is because handwriting is a complex motor skill that becomes highly personalized and habitual over time.

### A. The Basis of Handwriting Uniqueness
- **Early Learning:** When we first learn to write, we are taught a standard system (e.g., Palmer, Zaner-Bloser). At this stage, our writing is a conscious effort of "drawing" letters, and it exhibits primarily **class characteristics**.
- **Development of Habit:** As we become proficient, the act of writing becomes a subconscious, habitual process. We develop unique and personal ways of forming letters, connecting them, and spacing them on the page. These are our **individual characteristics**.
- **"Handwriting is Brainwriting":** The ultimate source of these variations is not the hand, but the brain, which sends the signals that control the muscles of the arm, hand, and fingers.

### B. Class vs. Individual Characteristics

1.  **Class Characteristics:** These are features and dimensions of handwriting that are common to a group of writers. They are the result of the writing system learned.
    - **Examples:** The style of letters taught in a particular school system, the general slant of writing.
    - **Value:** Useful for eliminating a writer if their class characteristics are fundamentally different from the questioned writing, but not sufficient for a positive identification.

2.  **Individual Characteristics:** These are the unique, repeated habits of a specific writer. The identification of a sufficient combination of unique individual characteristics is what leads to a positive identification.
    - **Examples:**
        - **Skill Level:** The writer's proficiency and fluency.
        - **Slant:** The angle of the writing.
        - **Spacing:** The spacing between letters, words, and lines.
        - **Letter Formations:** Unique ways of forming specific letters (e.g., the "t"-crossing, the "i"-dot).
        - **Connections:** The way letters are connected to each other.
        - **Pen Pressure and Shading:** Variations in pressure that create wider or narrower ink lines.

**The Identification Principle:**
A positive identification in handwriting analysis is made when the examiner finds a **sufficient quantity and quality of individual characteristics** in common between the questioned writing and the known standards, with no significant unexplained differences.

## II. Challenges in Handwriting Analysis

### A. Natural Variation
- No one signs their name or writes a passage exactly the same way twice. **Natural variation** refers to the normal, slight differences that occur in a person's repeated writings.
- An examiner must be able to distinguish between natural variation (which is expected) and a fundamental difference (which suggests a different writer).

### B. Disguise
- **Disguised writing** is an attempt by a writer to deliberately alter their handwriting to hide their identity.
- **Common Methods of Disguise:**
    - Writing with the non-dominant hand.
    - Changing the slant of the writing.
    - Writing in all capital letters.
- **Detection:** It is very difficult for a person to suppress all of their individual habits. A sufficient amount of writing will often reveal underlying individual characteristics that can still lead to an identification.

### C. Health and External Factors
- Factors such as old age, illness, injury (a broken arm), intoxication, or writing in an awkward position can all affect a person's handwriting. The examiner must take these factors into account when comparing samples.

## III. Typewriting Analysis

Before the advent of computers, the typewriter was the primary means of creating official documents. Forensic examiners developed methods to identify the specific typewriter that produced a document.

### A. The Basis of Typewriter Identification
- Just like any machine, a typewriter is subject to wear and tear. Over time, the individual typefaces (the metal pieces that strike the ribbon) can become worn, damaged, or misaligned.
- These defects create **individual characteristics** that are unique to that specific typewriter.

### B. The Examination Process
The examiner compares the questioned document to a known sample (an **exemplar**) typed on the suspect typewriter. They look for two types of characteristics:

1.  **Class Characteristics:** These relate to the make and model of the typewriter.
    - **Type Style:** The design of the letters (e.g., Pica, Elite).
    - **Pitch:** The number of letters per inch.
    - **Example:** A document typed in a Pica font could have come from any Smith-Corona typewriter with that font.

2.  **Individual Characteristics (Defects):** These are the unique flaws that identify a single machine.
    - **Vertical/Horizontal Misalignment:** A character prints consistently above or below the baseline, or to the left or right of its proper position.
    - **"Off its Feet":** A character prints heavier on one side than the other.
    - **Damaged Typeface:** A character has a specific nick, break, or other damage that is reproduced every time it is typed.

**The Identification Principle:**
A positive identification is made when the examiner finds a sufficient number of unique, repeating individual defects in common between the questioned document and the exemplar from the suspect typewriter.

### C. Modern Printers
- The principles of identifying documents from modern computer printers (inkjet, laser) are different.
- **Inkjet Printers:** Can sometimes be identified by minute imperfections in the spray nozzles.
- **Laser Printers:** Can sometimes be identified by "trash marks"—imperfections on the drum or rollers that leave repeating marks on the printed page.
- **Watermarks:** Some color laser printers embed a secret, nearly invisible pattern of tiny yellow dots on every page they print. This pattern can encode the printer's serial number and the date/time of printing, a feature designed to help track counterfeiters.

## Conclusion

Handwriting and typewriting analysis are classic disciplines within questioned document examination. They are both based on the same core principle: that repeated use, whether by a person or a machine, leads to the development of unique, identifiable habits and defects. While technology has changed, the fundamental task of the QDE remains the same: to find those unique characteristics amidst a sea of common features. By carefully comparing the questioned evidence to known standards, the examiner can answer critical questions about the authorship and origin of a document, providing key insights for an investigation.
