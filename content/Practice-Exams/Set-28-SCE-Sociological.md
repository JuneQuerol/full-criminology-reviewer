### 1. According to Merton's Strain Theory, which adaptation is most associated with criminal behavior?

- [ ] Conformity
- [x] Innovation
- [ ] Ritualism
- [ ] Retreatism

> Explanation: Innovation occurs when an individual accepts the cultural goal of success but rejects the institutionalized means to achieve it, resorting to illegitimate means like theft or drug dealing. Conformity accepts both, Ritualism rejects the goal but accepts the means, and Retreatism rejects both.

### 2. A community characterized by high residential mobility, ethnic heterogeneity, and poverty, leading to a breakdown of social institutions and higher crime rates, is best explained by which theory?

- [ ] Strain Theory
- [ ] Labeling Theory
- [x] Social Disorganization Theory
- [ ] Differential Association Theory

> Explanation: Shaw and McKay's Social Disorganization Theory posits that crime is a product of weakened social bonds and institutions in a neighborhood, not the characteristics of the people themselves. These specific factors (mobility, heterogeneity, poverty) are the core indicators of social disorganization.

### 3. "Criminal behavior is learned through interaction with others in a process of communication." This statement is the cornerstone of which theory?

- [ ] Social Control Theory
- [x] Differential Association Theory
- [ ] Social Learning Theory
- [ ] Anomie Theory

> Explanation: Edwin Sutherland's Differential Association Theory's primary tenet is that criminal behavior is learned in intimate personal groups. The theory emphasizes the learning of techniques, motives, drives, and rationalizations for committing crime.

### 4. How did Ronald Akers' Social Learning Theory expand upon Sutherland's Differential Association?

- [ ] By rejecting the idea that crime is learned
- [ ] By focusing only on classical conditioning
- [x] By incorporating principles of operant conditioning (reinforcement and punishment)
- [ ] By introducing the concept of the "looking-glass self"

> Explanation: Akers integrated the psychological principles of operant conditioning, arguing that behavior is shaped by its consequences. Criminal behavior is more likely to be repeated if it is reinforced (rewarded) and less likely if it is punished. This added a crucial mechanism to Sutherland's original framework.

### 5. Travis Hirschi's Social Bond Theory proposes that conformity is maintained by strong social bonds. Which of the following is NOT one of Hirschi's four elements of the social bond?

- [x] Ambition
- [ ] Attachment
- [ ] Commitment
- [ ] Belief

> Explanation: Hirschi's four elements are: 1) Attachment to others (e.g., family, friends), 2) Commitment to conventional goals (e.g., education, career), 3) Involvement in conventional activities, and 4) Belief in the moral validity of the law. Ambition is related to commitment but is not a distinct element itself.

### 6. A teenager is caught shoplifting. The court labels him a "delinquent," and he begins to internalize this label, leading to more serious and frequent offending. This process is known as:

- [ ] Primary Deviance
- [x] Secondary Deviance
- [ ] Tertiary Deviance
- [ ] Retrospective Interpretation

> Explanation: Edwin Lemert distinguished between primary deviance (the initial, often minor, act) and secondary deviance. Secondary deviance occurs after society reacts to the primary act, and the individual internalizes the deviant label, organizing their life and identity around it.

### 7. From a Conflict Theory perspective, who is most likely to be criminalized?

- [ ] A corporate executive who pollutes a river for profit
- [x] An unemployed person who steals food to survive
- [ ] A politician who accepts legal campaign donations from a corporation
- [ ] A student who cheats on an exam

> Explanation: Conflict theory, rooted in Marxism, argues that the law and the criminal justice system are tools used by the powerful (bourgeoisie) to control the powerless (proletariat). Therefore, the acts of the poor and marginalized are more likely to be defined and punished as crimes than the harmful acts of the wealthy and powerful.

### 8. The "Chicago School" of sociology is most famous for its contribution to which of the following theories?

- [ ] Strain Theory
- [x] Social Disorganization Theory
- [ ] Labeling Theory
- [ ] Social Control Theory

> Explanation: The Chicago School, particularly the work of Shaw and McKay, used the city of Chicago as a "social laboratory." Their ecological studies of urban neighborhoods laid the foundation for Social Disorganization Theory by mapping crime rates and correlating them with social and environmental characteristics.

### 9. Which theorist argued that crime is a "normal" and necessary social phenomenon that serves to reinforce collective sentiments and mark moral boundaries?

- [ ] Karl Marx
- [ ] Robert Merton
- [x] Emile Durkheim
- [ ] Howard Becker

> Explanation: Emile Durkheim, in his work on anomie, asserted that crime is an inevitable part of all societies. By punishing criminals, society reaffirms its shared values and moral consciousness. A society without crime would be pathologically over-controlled.

### 10. Routine Activities Theory requires the convergence of which three elements for a crime to occur?

- [ ] Poverty, Strain, and Labeling
- [x] A likely offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian
- [ ] A learned behavior, a social bond, and a deviant identity
- [ ] A cultural goal, institutionalized means, and an adaptation strategy

> Explanation: Cohen and Felson's Routine Activities Theory is a theory of victimization. It argues that crime happens when these three elements converge in time and space: someone motivated to offend, an accessible and valuable target, and no one (e.g., police, security, or even ordinary citizens) to prevent the crime.

### 11. Social Process Theories differ from Social Structure Theories in that they focus on:

- [ ] The macro-level effects of poverty and inequality.
- [x] The micro-level processes of how individuals become criminals.
- [ ] The biological and psychological traits of offenders.
- [ ] The historical development of criminal law.

> Explanation: Social Structure Theories (like Strain and Social Disorganization) explain crime by looking at broad societal or neighborhood-level factors. Social Process Theories (like Differential Association, Social Learning, and Control) focus on the individual's socialization and life experiences.

### 12. "Idle hands are the devil's workshop" is a saying that best captures which element of Hirschi's Social Bond Theory?

- [ ] Attachment
- [ ] Commitment
- [x] Involvement
- [ ] Belief

> Explanation: The "Involvement" element posits that spending a great deal of time in conventional, pro-social activities leaves little time or opportunity for deviance and crime.

### 13. According to Howard Becker, "social groups create deviance by making the rules whose infraction constitutes deviance..." This statement is a foundational concept for which theory?

- [ ] Conflict Theory
- [x] Labeling Theory
- [ ] Strain Theory
- [ ] Social Disorganization Theory

> Explanation: This quote from Becker's "Outsiders" is a classic articulation of Labeling Theory. It emphasizes that no act is inherently deviant; it only becomes so when a powerful group successfully defines it and labels the actor as such.

### 14. Which scenario is an example of "Retreatism" in Merton's Strain Theory?

- [ ] A lawyer who works hard but has given up on becoming a partner.
- [ ] A student who cheats on exams to get a high-paying job.
- [x] A person who becomes chronically addicted to drugs and drops out of society.
- [ ] A revolutionary who seeks to overthrow the government.

> Explanation: Retreatism involves rejecting both the cultural goals of success and the institutionalized means of achieving them. Individuals in this category, such as chronic drug addicts or homeless individuals, effectively "drop out" of the societal framework.

### 15. Richard Quinney, a prominent conflict theorist, would argue that the high rate of prosecution for street crimes compared to corporate crimes in the Philippines represents:

- [ ] A failure of law enforcement training.
- [ ] The natural outcome of a disorganized society.
- [x] The application of law for the benefit of the ruling class.
- [ ] A result of differential association among the poor.

> Explanation: Quinney argued that crime is a political phenomenon and that the legal system is an instrument of the state and ruling class to maintain and perpetuate their power and control. The focus on street crime deflects attention from the more harmful acts of the powerful.

### 16. The concept of "definitions favorable to violation of law" is central to:

- [x] Sutherland's Differential Association Theory
- [ ] Hirschi's Social Control Theory
- [ ] Merton's Strain Theory
- [ ] Becker's Labeling Theory

> Explanation: Sutherland argued that learning criminal behavior involves not just the techniques but also the motives, rationalizations, and attitudes. When an individual is exposed to more "definitions favorable to violation of law" than "definitions unfavorable," they are more likely to engage in crime.

### 17. A security guard preventing a robbery is an example of a "capable guardian" in which theory?

- [ ] Social Disorganization Theory
- [ ] Conflict Theory
- [x] Routine Activities Theory
- [ ] Social Learning Theory

> Explanation: In Routine Activities Theory, a capable guardian is any person or thing that discourages crime from occurring. This can be formal (police, security guards) or informal (neighbors, parents, CCTV cameras).

### 18. Anomie, as originally described by Emile Durkheim, refers to a state of:

- [ ] Social cohesion
- [x] Normlessness
- [ ] Collective efficacy
- [ ] Social learning

> Explanation: Durkheim used the term "anomie" to describe a condition where social and/or moral norms are weak, conflicting, or absent. This breakdown in social regulation can lead to higher rates of deviance, including suicide and crime.

### 19. Which of the following is a critique of Labeling Theory?

- [ ] It fails to consider the role of the powerful in defining crime.
- [ ] It overemphasizes the role of individual choice.
- [x] It cannot explain primary deviance or why people commit crimes before being labeled.
- [ ] It focuses too much on macro-level social structures.

> Explanation: Labeling theory is excellent at explaining secondary deviance (the continuation of crime after a label is applied), but it doesn't explain what causes the initial act of deviance (primary deviance) in the first place.

### 20. Social Structure theories locate the root cause of crime in:

- [ ] Individual psychology
- [ ] Learned behaviors
- [x] The physical and social environment
- [ ] The process of stigmatization

> Explanation: Theories like Strain and Social Disorganization are "structural" because they argue that crime is a result of the structure of society itself—such as the unequal distribution of opportunities (Strain) or the deterioration of neighborhood institutions (Social Disorganization).

### 21. A teenager refrains from shoplifting because he is afraid of disappointing his parents. This is an example of which social bond element?

- [x] Attachment
- [ ] Commitment
- [ ] Involvement
- [ ] Belief

> Explanation: Attachment refers to the emotional connection and sensitivity to the opinions of others, especially parents, teachers, and peers. The fear of disappointing a loved one is a powerful form of informal social control.

### 22. In the concentric zone model developed by the Chicago School, which zone was identified as having the highest crime rates?

- [ ] The Loop (Central Business District)
- [x] The Zone of Transition
- [ ] The Working-Class Zone
- [ ] The Commuter Zone

> Explanation: Shaw and McKay found that the Zone of Transition, located just outside the central business district, consistently had the highest crime rates, regardless of which ethnic group lived there. This zone was characterized by industrial encroachment, poverty, and high population turnover.

### 23. The idea that criminals are not fundamentally different from non-criminals, but are simply people who have been successfully stigmatized, is a key tenet of:

- [ ] Social Control Theory
- [x] Labeling Theory
- [ ] Strain Theory
- [ ] Routine Activities Theory

> Explanation: Labeling theory challenges the notion of inherent criminality. It posits that "deviant" is a status conferred upon an individual, and the application of this label is the critical factor in the development of a criminal career.

### 24. A politician who embezzles public funds to achieve the cultural goal of wealth is demonstrating which of Merton's adaptations?

- [ ] Rebellion
- [ ] Ritualism
- [x] Innovation
- [ ] Conformity

> Explanation: This is a classic example of Innovation. The politician accepts the goal of financial success but uses illegitimate (criminal) means—embezzlement—to achieve it, rather than the approved institutionalized means.

### 25. According to Akers' Social Learning Theory, what is "differential reinforcement"?

- [ ] Learning to differentiate between right and wrong.
- [ ] Associating with different types of people.
- [x] The balance of anticipated or actual rewards and punishments for a behavior.
- [ ] The process of being labeled differently by society.

> Explanation: Differential reinforcement is the core behavioral component of Akers' theory. It means that a person will choose to engage in the behavior that has been most rewarding to them in the past or that they anticipate will be most rewarding in the future.

### 26. Which theory would be most concerned with the creation and enforcement of laws against vagrancy and loitering in the Philippines?

- [ ] Social Disorganization Theory
- [ ] Routine Activities Theory
- [x] Conflict Theory
- [ ] Social Bond Theory

> Explanation: Conflict theorists would view laws against vagrancy and loitering as tools used by the powerful to control the poor and unemployed (the "surplus labor" population), who are seen as a potential threat to the social order.

### 27. Edwin Lemert is most associated with the concepts of:

- [ ] Social bonds and self-control.
- [ ] Anomie and strain.
- [x] Primary and secondary deviance.
- [ ] Differential association and definitions.

> Explanation: Lemert's most significant contribution to criminology, specifically Labeling Theory, was the crucial distinction between primary deviance (the act) and secondary deviance (the societal reaction and internalization of the label).

### 28. "Conformity to the law is not taken for granted; rather, crime is the expected outcome when social controls are weak." This statement best summarizes the main question asked by:

- [ ] Strain Theory ("Why do people break the rules?")
- [x] Social Control Theory ("Why don't people break the rules?")
- [ ] Labeling Theory ("Who applies the rules to whom?")
- [ ] Differential Association Theory ("How do people learn to break the rules?")

> Explanation: Unlike most other theories that try to explain why people commit crime, Control Theory (like Hirschi's) flips the question. It assumes people are naturally motivated towards self-interest and deviance, so the real question is what forces (bonds, controls) prevent them from doing so.

### 29. According to Shaw and McKay's research, what was the most critical factor in determining the crime rate of a neighborhood?

- [ ] The racial and ethnic composition of the residents.
- [ ] The level of police presence.
- [x] The structural conditions of the neighborhood itself.
- [ ] The average IQ of the residents.

> Explanation: A key finding of the Chicago School was that high crime rates persisted in the same neighborhoods over time, even as different ethnic groups moved in and out. This demonstrated that the cause of crime was the nature of the neighborhood (poverty, mobility, disorganization), not the characteristics of the people.

### 30. Which of these is a social process theory, NOT a social structure theory?

- [ ] Merton's Strain Theory
- [ ] Shaw and McKay's Social Disorganization Theory
- [x] Sutherland's Differential Association Theory
- [ ] Anomie Theory

> Explanation: Differential Association Theory focuses on the process of learning through social interaction on an individual level. Strain and Social Disorganization theories are structural, as they attribute crime to macro-level societal forces and neighborhood conditions.
